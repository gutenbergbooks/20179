<h3>PREFATORY NOTE.</h3>

  <p>It is necessary to explain that in the present edition of the Ship of
  Fools, with a view to both philological and bibliographical interests,
  the text, even to the punctuation, has been printed exactly as it stands
  in the earlier impression (Pynson's), the authenticity of which Barclay
  himself thus vouches for in a deprecatory apology at the end of his
  labours (II. 330):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"... some wordes be in my boke amys</p>
      <p>For though that I my selfe dyd it correct</p>
      <p>Yet with some fautis I knowe it is infect</p>
      <p>Part by my owne ouersyght and neglygence</p>
      <p>And part by the prynters nat perfyte in science</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Yet the differences of reading of the later edition (Cawood's), are
  surprisingly few and mostly unimportant, though great pains were
  evidently bestowed on the production of the book, all the misprints being
  carefully corrected, and the orthography duly adjusted to the fashion of
  the time. These differences have, in this edition, been placed in one
  alphabetical arrangement with the glossary, by which plan it is believed
  reference to them will be made more easy, and much repetition
  avoided.</p>

  <p>The woodcuts, no less valuable for their artistic merit than they are
  interesting as pictures of contemporary manners, have been facsimiled for
  the present edition from the <i>originals</i> as they appear in the Basle
  edition of the Latin, "denuo seduloque reuisa," issued under Brandt's own
  superintendence in 1497. This work has been done by Mr J. T. Reid, to
  whom it is due to say that he has executed it with the most painstaking
  and scrupulous fidelity.</p>

  <p>The portrait of Brandt, which forms the frontispiece to this volume,
  is taken from Zarncke's edition of the Narrenschiff; that of Barclay
  presenting one of his books to his patron, prefixed to the Notice of his
  life, appears with a little more detail in the Mirror of Good Manners and
  the Pynson editions of the Sallust; it is, however, of no authority,
  being used for a similar purpose in various other publications.</p>

  <p>For the copy of the extremely rare original edition from which the
  text of the present has been printed, I am indebted to the private
  collection and the well known liberality of Mr David Laing of the Signet
  Library, to whom I beg here to return my best thanks, for this as well as
  many other valuable favours in connection with the present work.</p>

  <p>In prosecuting enquiries regarding the life of an author of whom so
  little is known as of Barclay, one must be indebted for aid, more or
  less, to the kindness of friends. In this way I have to acknowledge my
  obligations to Mr Æneas Mackay, Advocate, and Mr Ralph Thomas, ("Olphar
  Hamst"), for searches made in the British Museum and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>For collations of Barclay's Works, other than the Ship of Fools, all
  of which are of the utmost degree of rarity, and consequent
  inaccessibility, I am indebted to the kindness of Henry Huth, Esq., 30
  Princes' Gate, Kensington; the Rev. W. D. Macray, of the Bodleian
  Library, Oxford; W. B. Rye, Esq., of the British Museum; Henry Bradshaw,
  Esq., of the University Library, Cambridge; and Professor Skeat,
  Cambridge.</p>

  <p>For my brief notice of Brandt and his Work, it is also proper to
  acknowledge my obligations to Zarncke's critical edition of the
  Narrenschiff (Leipzig, 1854) which is a perfect encyclopædia of
  everything Brandtian.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

  <p>If popularity be taken as the measure of success in literary effort,
  Sebastian Brandt's "Ship of Fools" must be considered one of the most
  successful books recorded in the whole history of literature. Published
  in edition after edition (the first dated 1494), at a time, but shortly
  after the invention of printing, when books were expensive, and their
  circulation limited; translated into the leading languages of Europe at a
  time when translations of new works were only the result of the most
  signal merits, its success was then quite unparalleled. It may be said,
  in modern phrase, to have been the rage of the reading world at the end
  of the fifteenth and throughout the sixteenth centuries. It was
  translated into Latin by one Professor (Locher, 1497), and imitated in
  the same language and under the same title, by another (Badius Ascensius,
  1507); it appeared in Dutch and Low German, and was twice translated into
  English, and three times into French; imitations competed with the
  original in French and German, as well as Latin, and greatest and most
  unprecedented distinction of all, it was preached, but, we should opine,
  only certain parts of it, from the pulpit by the best preachers of the
  time as a new gospel. The Germans proudly award it the epithet,
  "epoch-making," and its long-continued popularity affords good, if not
  quite sufficient, ground for the extravagant eulogies they lavish upon
  it. Trithemius calls it "Divina Satira," and doubts whether anything
  could have been written more suited to the spirit of the age; Locher
  compares Brandt with Dante, and Hutten styles him the new law-giver of
  German poetry.</p>

  <p>A more recent and impartial critic (Müller, "Chips from a German
  Workshop," Vol. III.), thus suggestively sets forth the varied grounds of
  Brandt's wonderful popularity:&mdash;"His satires, it is true, are not
  very powerful, nor pungent, nor original. But his style is free and easy.
  Brant is not a ponderous poet. He writes in short chapters, and mixes his
  fools in such a manner that we always meet with a variety of new faces.
  It is true that all this would hardly be sufficient to secure a decided
  success for a work like his at the present day. But then we must remember
  the time in which he wrote.... There was room at that time for a work
  like the 'Ship of Fools.' It was the first printed book that treated of
  contemporaneous events and living persons, instead of old German battles
  and French knights. People are always fond of reading the history of
  their own times. If the good qualities of their age are brought out, they
  think of themselves or their friends; if the dark features of their
  contemporaries are exhibited, they think of their neighbours and enemies.
  Now the 'Ship of Fools' is just such a satire which ordinary people would
  read, and read with pleasure. They might feel a slight twinge now and
  then, but they would put down the book at the end, and thank God that
  they were not like other men. There is a chapter on Misers&mdash;and who
  would not gladly give a penny to a beggar? There is a chapter on
  Gluttony&mdash;and who was ever more than a little exhilarated after
  dinner?</p>

  <p>There is a chapter on Church-goers&mdash;and who ever went to church
  for respectability's sake, or to show off a gaudy dress, or a fine dog,
  or a new hawk? There is a chapter on Dancing&mdash;and who ever danced
  except for the sake of exercise? There is a chapter on Adultery&mdash;and
  who ever did more than flirt with his neighbour's wife? We sometimes wish
  that Brant's satire had been a little more searching, and that, instead
  of his many allusions to classical fools (for his book is full of
  scholarship), he had given us a little more of the <i>chronique
  scandaleuse</i> of his own time. But he was too good a man to do this,
  and his contemporaries were no doubt grateful to him for his
  forbearance."</p>

  <p>Brandt's satire is a satire for all time. Embodied in the language of
  the fifteenth century, coloured with the habits and fashions of the
  times, executed after the manner of working of the period, and motived by
  the eager questioning spirit and the discontent with "abusions" and
  "folyes" which resulted in the Reformation, this satire in its morals or
  lessons is almost as applicable to the year of grace 1873 as to the year
  of gracelessness 1497. It never can grow old; in the mirror in which the
  men of his time saw themselves reflected, the men of all times can
  recognise themselves; a crew of "able-bodied" is never wanting to man
  this old, weather-beaten, but ever seaworthy vessel. The thoughtful,
  penetrating, conscious spirit of the Basle professor passing by, for the
  most part, local, temporary or indifferent points, seized upon the
  never-dying follies of <i>human nature</i> and impaled them on the
  printed page for the amusement, the edification, and the warning of
  contemporaries and posterity alike. No petty writer of laborious <i>vers
  de societe</i> to raise a laugh for a week, a month, or a year, and to be
  buried in utter oblivion for ever after, was he, but a divine seer who
  saw the weakness and wickedness of the hearts of men, and warned them to
  amend their ways and flee from the wrath to come. Though but a retired
  student, and teacher of the canon law, a humble-minded man of letters,
  and a diffident imperial Counsellor, yet is he to be numbered among the
  greatest Evangelists and Reformers of mediæval Europe whose trumpet-toned
  tongue penetrated into regions where the names of Luther or Erasmus were
  but an empty sound, if even that. And yet, though helping much the cause
  of the Reformation by the freedom of his social and clerical criticism,
  by his unsparing exposure of every form of corruption and injustice, and,
  not least, by his use of the vernacular for political and religious
  purposes, he can scarcely be classed in the great army of the Protestant
  Reformers. He was a reformer from within, a biting, unsparing exposer of
  every priestly abuse, but a loyal son of the Church, who rebuked the
  faults of his brethren, but visited with the pains of Hell those of "fals
  herytikes," and wept over the "ruyne, inclynacion, and decay of the holy
  fayth Catholyke, and dymynucion of the Empyre."</p>

  <p>So while he was yet a reformer in the true sense of the word, he was
  too much of the scholar to be anything but a true conservative. To his
  scholarly habit of working, as well as to the manner of the time which
  hardly trusted in the value of its own ideas but loved to lean them upon
  classical authority, is no doubt owing the classical mould in which his
  satire is cast. The description of every folly is strengthened by notice
  of its classical or biblical prototypes, and in the margin of the Latin
  edition of Locher, Brandt himself supplied the citations of the books and
  passages which formed the basis of his text, which greatly added to the
  popularity of the work. Brandt, indeed, with the modesty of genius,
  professes that it is really no more than a collection and translation of
  quotations from biblical and classical authors, "Gesamlet durch
  Sebastian<span class="over">u</span> Brant." But even admitting the work
  to be a Mosaic, to adopt the reply of its latest German editor to the
  assertion that it is but a compilation testifying to the most painstaking
  industry and the consumption of midnight oil, "even so one learns that a
  Mosaic is a work of art when executed with artistic skill." That he
  caused the classical and biblical passages flitting before his eyes to be
  cited in the margin proves chiefly only the excellence of his memory.
  They are also before our eyes and yet we are not always able to answer
  the question: where, <i>e.g.</i>, does this occur? ... Where,
  <i>e.g.</i>, occur the following appropriate words of Goethe: "Who can
  think anything foolish, who can think anything wise, that antiquity has
  not already thought of."</p>

  <p>Of the Greek authors, Plutarch only is used, and he evidently by means
  of a Latin translation. But from the Latin large draughts of inspiration
  are taken, direct from the fountainhead. Ovid, Juvenal, Persius,
  Catullus, and Seneca, are largely drawn from, while, strangely enough,
  Cicero, Boethius, and Virgil are quoted but seldom, the latter, indeed,
  only twice, though his commentators, especially Servetus, are frequently
  employed. The Bible, of course, is a never-failing source of
  illustration, and, as was to be expected, the Old Testament much more
  frequently than the New, most use being made of the Proverbs of Solomon,
  while Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiasticus, and the Sapientia follow at no great
  distance.</p>

  <p>The quotations are made apparently direct from the Vulgate, in only a
  few cases there being a qualification of the idea by the interpretation
  of the Corpus Juris Canonici. But through this medium only, as was to be
  expected of the professor of canon law, is the light of the fathers of
  the Church allowed to shine upon us, and according to Zarncke
  (Introduction to his edition of the Narrenschiff, 1854), use of it has
  certainly been made far oftener than the commentary shows, the sources of
  information of which are of the most unsatisfactory character. On such
  solid and tried foundations did Brandt construct his great work, and the
  judgment of contemporaries and posterity alike has declared the
  superstructure to be worthy of its supports.</p>

  <p>The following admirable notice from Ersch and Grüber (Encyclopädie)
  sums up so skilfully the history, nature, and qualities of the book that
  we quote at length:&mdash;"The Ship of Fools was received with almost
  unexampled applause by high and low, learned and unlearned, in Germany,
  Switzerland, and France, and was made the common property of the greatest
  part of literary Europe, through Latin, French, English, and Dutch
  translations. For upwards of a century it was in Germany a <i>book of the
  people</i> in the noblest and widest sense of the word, alike appreciated
  by an Erasmus and a Reuchlin, and by the mechanics of Strassburg, Basel,
  and Augsburg; and it was assumed to be so familiar to all classes, that
  even during Brandt's lifetime, the German preacher Gailer von Kaiserberg
  went so far as to deliver public lectures from the pulpit on his friend's
  poem as if it had been a scriptural text. As to the poetical and humorous
  character of Brandt's poem, its whole conception does not display any
  extraordinary power of imagination, nor does it present in its details
  any very striking sallies of wit and humour, even when compared with
  older German works of a similar kind, such as that of Renner. The
  fundamental idea of the poem consists in the shipping off of several
  shiploads of fools of all kinds for their native country, which, however,
  is visible at a distance only; and one would have expected the poet to
  have given poetical consistency to his work by fully carrying out this
  idea of a ship's crew, and sailing to the 'Land of Fools.' It is,
  however, at intervals only that Brandt reminds us of the allegory; the
  fools who are carefully divided into classes and introduced to us in
  succession, instead of being ridiculed or derided, are reproved in a
  liberal spirit, with noble earnestness, true moral feeling, and practical
  common sense. It was the straightforward, the bold and liberal spirit of
  the poet which so powerfully addressed his contemporaries from the Ship
  of the Fools; and to us it is valuable as a product of the piety and
  morality of the century which paved the way for the Reformation. Brandt's
  fools are represented as contemptible and loathsome rather than
  <i>foolish</i>, and what he calls follies might be more correctly
  described as sins and vices.</p>

  <p>"The 'Ship of Fools' is written in the dialect of Swabia, and consists
  of vigorous, resonant, and rhyming iambic quadrameters. It is divided
  into 113 sections, each of which, with the exception of a short
  introduction and two concluding pieces, treats independently of a certain
  class of fools or vicious persons; and we are only occasionally reminded
  of the fundamental idea by an allusion to the ship. No folly of the
  century is left uncensured. The poet attacks with noble zeal the failings
  and extravagances of his age, and applies his lash unsparingly even to
  the dreaded Hydra of popery and monasticism, to combat which the Hercules
  of Wittenberg had not yet kindled his firebrands. But the poet's object
  was not merely to reprove and to animadvert; he instructs also, and shows
  the fools the way to the land of wisdom; and so far is he from assuming
  the arrogant air of the commonplace moralist, that he reckons himself
  among the number of fools. The style of the poem is lively, bold, and
  simple, and often remarkably terse, especially in his moral sayings, and
  renders it apparent that the author was a classical scholar, without
  however losing anything of his German character."</p>

  <p>Brandt's humour, which either his earnestness or his manner banished
  from the text, took refuge in the illustrations and there disported
  itself with a wild zest and vigour. Indeed to their popularity several
  critics have ascribed the success of the book, but for this there is no
  sufficient authority or probability. Clever as they are, it is more
  probable that they ran, in popularity, but an equal race with the text.
  The precise amount of Brandt's workmanship in them has not been
  ascertained, but it is agreed that "most of them, if not actually drawn,
  were at least suggested by him." Zarncke remarks regarding their artistic
  worth, "not all of the cuts are of equal value. One can easily
  distinguish five different workers, and more practised eyes would
  probably be able to increase the number. In some one can see how the
  outlines, heads, hands, and other principal parts are cut with the fine
  stroke of the master, and the details and shading left to the scholars.
  The woodcuts of the most superior master, which can be recognized at
  once, and are about a third of the whole, belong to the finest, if they
  are not, indeed, the finest, which were executed in the fifteenth
  century, a worthy school of Holbein. According to the opinion of Herr
  Rudolph Weigel, they might possibly be the work of Martin Schön of
  Colmar.... The composition in the better ones is genuinely Hogarth-like,
  and the longer one looks at these little pictures, the more is one
  astonished at the fulness of the humour, the fineness of the
  characterisation and the almost dramatic talent of the grouping." Green,
  in his recent work on emblems, characterizes them as marking an epoch in
  that kind of literature. And Dibdin, the Macaulay of bibliography, loses
  his head in admiration of the "entertaining volume," extolling the
  figures without stint for "merit in conception and execution," "bold and
  free pencilling," "spirit and point," "delicacy, truth, and force,"
  "spirit of drollery," &amp;c., &amp;c.; summarising thus, "few books are
  more pleasing to the eye, and more gratifying to the fancy than the early
  editions of the 'Stultifera Navis.' It presents a combination of
  entertainment to which the curious can never be indifferent."</p>

  <p>Whether it were the racy cleverness of the pictures or the
  unprecedented boldness of the text, the book stirred Europe of the
  fifteenth century in a way and with a rapidity it had never been stirred
  before. In the German actual acquaintance with it could then be but
  limited, though it ran through seventeen editions within a century; the
  Latin version brought it to the knowledge of the educated class
  throughout Europe; but, expressing, as it did mainly, the feelings of the
  common people, to have it in the learned language was not enough.
  Translations into various vernaculars were immediately called for, and
  the Latin edition having lightened the translator's labours, they were
  speedily supplied. England, however, was all but last in the field but
  when she did appear, it was in force, with a version in each hand, the
  one in prose and the other in verse.</p>

  <p>Fifteen years elapsed from the appearance of the first German edition,
  before the English metrical version "translated out of Laten, French, and
  Doche ... in the colege of Saynt Mary Otery, by me, Alexander Barclay,"
  was issued from the press of Pynson in 1509. A translation, however, it
  is not. Properly speaking, it is an adaptation, an English ship, formed
  and fashioned after the Ship of Fools of the World. "But concernynge the
  translacion of this boke; I exhort ye reders to take no displesour for
  y<sup>t</sup>, it is nat translated word by worde acordinge to ye verses
  of my actour. For I haue but only drawen into our moder tunge, in rude
  langage the sentences of the verses as nere as the parcyte of my wyt wyl
  suffer me, some tyme addynge, somtyme detractinge and takinge away suche
  thinges as semeth me necessary and superflue. Wherfore I desyre of you
  reders pardon of my presumptuous audacite, trustynge that ye shall holde
  me excused if ye consyder ye scarsnes of my wyt and my vnexpert youthe. I
  haue in many places ouerpassed dyuers poetical digressions and obscurenes
  of fables and haue concluded my worke in rude langage as shal apere in my
  translacion."</p>

  <p>"Wylling to redres the errours and vyces of this oure royalme of
  England ... I haue taken upon me ... the translacion of this present boke
  ... onely for the holsome instruccion commodyte and doctryne of wysdome,
  and to clense the vanyte and madness of folysshe people of whom ouer
  great nombre is in the Royalme of Englonde."</p>

  <p>Actuated by these patriotic motives, Barclay has, while preserving all
  the valuable characteristics of his original, painted for posterity
  perhaps the most graphic and comprehensive picture now preserved of the
  folly, injustice, and iniquity which demoralized England, city and
  country alike, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and rendered it
  ripe for any change political or religious.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The national tone and aim of the English "Ship" are maintained
  throughout with the greatest emphasis, exhibiting an independence of
  spirit which few ecclesiastics of the time would have dared to own.
  Barclay seems to have been first an Englishman, then an ecclesiastic.
  Everywhere throughout his great work the voice of the people is heard to
  rise and ring through the long exposure of abuse and injustice, and had
  the authorship been unknown it would most certainly have been ascribed to
  a Langlande of the period. Everywhere he takes what we would call the
  popular side, the side of the people as against those in office.
  Everywhere he stands up boldly in behalf of the oppressed, and spares not
  the oppressor, even if he be of his own class. He applies the cudgel as
  vigorously to the priest's pate as to the Lolardes back. But he disliked
  modern innovation as much as ancient abuse, in this also faithfully
  reflecting the mind of the people, and he is as emphatic in his censure
  of the one as in his condemnation of the other.</p>

  <p>Barclay's "Ship of Fools," however, is not only important as a picture
  of the English life and popular feeling of his time, it is, both in style
  and vocabulary, a most valuable and remarkable monument of the English
  language. Written midway between Chaucer and Spenser, it is infinitely
  more easy to read than either. Page after page, even in the antique
  spelling of Pynson's edition, may be read by the ordinary reader of
  to-day without reference to a dictionary, and when reference is required
  it will be found in nine cases out of ten that the archaism is Saxon, not
  Latin. This is all the more remarkable, that it occurs in the case of a
  priest translating mainly from the Latin and French, and can only be
  explained with reference to his standpoint as a social reformer of the
  broadest type, and to his evident intention that his book should be an
  appeal to all classes, but especially to the mass of the people, for
  amendment of their follies. In evidence of this it may be noticed that in
  the didactic passages, and especially in the L'envois, which are
  additions of his own, wherever, in fact, he appears in his own character
  of "preacher," his language is most simple, and his vocabulary of the
  most Saxon description.</p>

  <p>In his prologue "excusynge the rudenes of his translacion," he
  professes to have purposely used the most "comon speche":&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My speche is rude my termes comon and rural</p>
      <p>And I for rude peple moche more conuenient</p>
      <p>Than for estates, lerned men, or eloquent."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>He afterwards humorously supplements this in "the prologe,"
  by:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But if I halt in meter or erre in eloquence</p>
      <p>Or be to large in langage I pray you blame not me</p>
      <p>For my mater is so bad it wyll none other be."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So much the better for all who are interested in studying the
  development of our language and literature. For thus we have a volume,
  confessedly written in the commonest language of the common people, from
  which the philologist may at once see the stage at which they had arrived
  in the development of a simple English speech, and how far, in this
  respect, the spoken language had advanced a-head of the written; and from
  which also he can judge to what extent the popularity of a book depends,
  when the language is in a state of transition, upon the unusual
  simplicity of its style both in structure and vocabulary, and how far it
  may, by reason of its popularity, be influential in modifying and
  improving the language in both these respects. In the long barren tract
  between Chaucer and Spenser, the Ship of Fools stands all but alone as a
  popular poem, and the continuance of this popularity for a century and
  more is no doubt to be attributed as much to the use of the language of
  the "coming time" as to the popularity of the subject.</p>

  <p>In more recent times however, Barclay has, probably in part, from
  accidental circumstances, come to be relegated to a position among the
  English classics, those authors whom every one speaks of but few read.
  That modern editions of at least his principal performance have not
  appeared, can only be accounted for by the great expense attendant upon
  the reproduction of so uniquely illustrated a work, an interesting proof
  of which, given in the evidence before the Select Committee of the House
  of Commons on the Copyright act in 1818, is worth quoting. Amongst new
  editions of standard but costly works, of which the tax then imposed by
  the act upon publishers of giving eleven copies of all their publications
  free to certain libraries prevented the publication, is mentioned,
  Barclay's "Ship of Fools;" regarding which Harding, the well known
  bookseller, is reported to have said, "We have declined republishing the
  'Ship of Fools,' a folio volume of great rarity and high price. Our
  probable demand would not have been more than for a hundred copies, at
  the price of 12 guineas each. The delivery of eleven copies to the public
  libraries decided us against entering into the speculation."</p>

  <p>A wider and more eager interest is now being manifested in our early
  literature, and especially in our early popular poetry, to the
  satisfaction of which, it is believed, a new edition of this book will be
  regarded as a most valuable contribution. Indeed, as a graphic and
  comprehensive picture of the social condition of pre-Reformation England;
  as an important influence in the formation of our modern English tongue;
  and as a rich and unique exhibition of early art, to all of which
  subjects special attention is being at present directed, this mediæval
  picture-poem is of unrivalled interest.</p>

<h3>ALEXANDER BARCLAY.</h3>

  <p>Whether this distinguished poet was an Englishman or a Scotchman has
  long been a <i>quæstio vexata</i> affording the literary antiquary a
  suitable field for the display of his characteristic amenity. Bale, the
  oldest authority, simply says that some contend he was a Scot, others an
  Englishman, (Script. Illust. Majoris Britt. Catalogus, 1559). Pits (De
  Illust. Angliæ Script.,) asserts that though to some he appears to have
  been a Scot, he was really an Englishman, and probably a native of
  Devonshire, ("<i>nam</i> ibi ad S. Mariam de Otery, Presbyter primum
  fuit"). Wood again, (Athen. Oxon.), by the reasoning which finds a
  likeness between Macedon and Monmouth, because there is a river in each,
  arrives at "Alexander de Barklay, seems to have been born at or near a
  town so called in Somersetshire;" upon which Ritson pertinently observes,
  "there is no such place in Somersetshire, the onely Berkeley known is in
  Gloucestershire." Warton, coming to the question double-shotted, observes
  that "he was most probably of Devonshire or Gloucestershire," in the one
  case following Pits, and in the other anticipating Ritson's
  observation.</p>

  <p>On the other hand Bale, in an earlier work than the <i>Catalogus</i>,
  the <i>Summarium Ill. Maj. Britt. Script.</i>, published in 1548, during
  Barclay's life time, adorns him with the epithets "Scotus, rhetor ac
  poeta insignis." Dempster (Hist. ecclesiastica), styles him "Scotus, ut
  retulit ipse Joannes Pitsæus." Holinshed also styles him "Scot"! Sibbald
  gives him a place in his (MS.) Catalogues of Scottish poets, as does also
  Wodrow in his Catalogues of Scots writers. Mackenzie (Lives of the Scots
  writers) begins, "The Barklies, from whom this gentleman is descended,
  are of a very ancient standing in Scotland." Ritson (Bib. Poetica), after
  a caustic review of the controversy, observes "both his name of baptism
  and the orthography of his surname seem to prove that he was of Scottish
  extraction." Bliss (Additions to Wood) is of opinion that he "undoubtedly
  was not a native of England," and Dr Irving (Hist. of Scot. Poetry)
  adheres to the opinion of Ritson.</p>

  <p>Such contention, whatever may be the weight of the evidence on either
  side, is at any rate a sufficient proof of the eminence of the individual
  who is the subject of it; to be his birthplace being considered an honour
  of so much value to the country able to prove its claim to the
  distinction as to occasion a literary warfare of several centuries'
  duration.</p>

  <p>We cannot profess to have brought such reinforcements to either side
  as to obtain for it a complete and decisive victory, but their number and
  character are such as will probably induce one of the combatants quietly
  to retire from the field. In the first place, a more explicit and
  unimpeachable piece of evidence than any contained in the authors
  mentioned above has been found, strangely enough, in a medical treatise,
  published about twenty years after Barclay's death, by a physician and
  botanist of great eminence in the middle of the sixteenth century, who
  was a native of the isle of Ely, at the Monastery of which Barclay was
  for some time a monk.</p>

  <p>It is entitled "A dialogue both pleasaunt and pietifull, wherein is a
  godlie regiment against the Fever Pestilence, with a consolation and
  comforte against death.&mdash;Newlie corrected by William Bullein, the
  author thereof.&mdash;Imprinted at London by Ihon Kingston. Julij, 1573."
  [8vo., B.L., 111 leaves.] "There was an earlier impression of this work
  in 1564, but the edition of 1573 was 'corrected by the author,' the last
  work on which he probably was engaged, as he died in 1576. It is of no
  value at this time of day as a medical treatise, though the author was
  very eminent; but we advert to it because Bullein, for the sake of
  variety and amusement, introduces notices of Chaucer, Gower, Lidgate,
  Skelton, and Barclay, which, coming from a man who was contemporary with
  two of them, may be accepted as generally accurate representations....
  Alexander Barclay, Dr Bullein calls Bartlet, in the irregular spelling of
  those times; and, asserting that he was 'born beyond the cold river of
  Tweed,' we see no sufficient reason for disbelieving that he was a native
  of Scotland. Barclay, after writing his pastorals, &amp;c., did not die
  until 1552, so that Bullein was his contemporary, and most likely knew
  him and the fact. He observes:&mdash;'Then Bartlet, with an hoopyng
  russet long coate, with a pretie hoode in his necke, and five knottes
  upon his girdle, after Francis tricks. He was borne beyonde the cold
  river of Twede. He lodged upon a swete bed of chamomill, under the
  sinamum tree; about hym many shepherdes and shepe, with pleasaunte pipes;
  greatly abhorring the life of Courtiers, Citizens, Usurers, and
  Banckruptes, &amp;c., whose olde daies are miserable. And the estate of
  shepherdes and countrie people he accoumpted moste happie and sure."
  (Collier's "Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature," Vol.
  1., P. 97).</p>

  <p>"The certainty with which Bulleyn here speaks of Barclay, as born
  beyond the Tweed, is not a little strengthened by the accuracy with which
  even in allegory he delineates his peculiar characteristics. 'He lodged
  upon a bed of sweet camomile.' What figure could have been more
  descriptive of that agreeable bitterness, that pleasant irony, which
  distinguishes the author of the 'Ship of Fools?' 'About him many
  shepherds and sheep with pleasant pipes, greatly abhorring the life of
  courtiers.' What could have been a plainer paraphrase of the title of
  Barclay's 'Eclogues,' or 'Miseries of Courtiers and Courtes, and of all
  Princes in General.' As a minor feature, 'the five knots upon his girdle
  after Francis's tricks' may also be noticed. Hitherto, the fact of
  Barclay having been a member of the Franciscan order has been always
  repeated as a matter of some doubt; 'he was a monk of the order of St
  Benedict, and afterwards, as some say, a Franciscan. Bulleyn knows, and
  mentions, with certainty, what others only speak of as the merest
  conjecture. In short, everything tends to shew a degree of familiar
  acquaintance with the man, his habits, and his productions, which
  entitles the testimony of Bulleyn to the highest credit.'" (Lives of the
  Scottish Poets, Vol. I., pt. ii., p. 77).</p>

  <p>But there are other proofs pointing as decidedly to the determination
  of this long-continued controversy in favour of Scotland, as the soil
  from which this vagrant child of the muses sprung. No evidence seems to
  have been hitherto sought from the most obvious source, his writings. The
  writer of the memoir in the Biographia Brittanica, (who certainly dealt a
  well-aimed, though by no means decisive, blow, in observing, "It is
  pretty extraordinary that Barclay himself, in his several addresses to
  his patrons should never take notice of his being a stranger, which would
  have made their kindness to him the more remarkable [it was very
  customary for the writers of that age to make mention in their works of
  the countries to which they belonged, especially if they wrote out of
  their own];<a name="Ft_1" href="#FtN_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> whereas the
  reader will quickly see, that in his address to the young gentlemen of
  England in the 'Mirror of Good Manners,' he treats them as his
  countrymen,") has remarked, "It seems a little strange that in those days
  a Scot should obtain so great reputation in England, especially if it be
  considered from whence our author's rose, viz., from his enriching and
  improving the English tongue. Had he written in Latin or on the sciences,
  the thing had been probable enough, but in the light in which it now
  stands, I think it very far from likely." From which it is evident that
  the biographer understood not the versatile nature of the Scot and his
  ability, especially when caught young, in "doing in Rome as the Romans
  do." Barclay's English education and foreign travel, together extending
  over the most impressionable years of his youth, could not have failed to
  rub off any obvious national peculiarities of speech acquired in early
  boyhood, had the difference between the English and Scottish speech then
  been wider than it was. But the language of Barbour and Chaucer was
  really one and the same. It will then not be wondered at that but few
  Scotch words are found in Barclay's writings. Still, these few are not
  without their importance in strengthening the argument as to nationality.
  The following from "The Ship of Fools," indicate at once the clime to
  which they are native, "gree," "kest," "rawky," "ryue," "yate," "bokest,"
  "bydeth," "thekt," and "or," in its peculiar Scottish use.<a name="Ft_2"
  href="#FtN_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> That any Englishman, especially a South
  or West of England Englishman, should use words such as those,
  particularly at a time of hostility and of little intercourse between the
  nations, will surely be admitted to be a far more unlikely thing than
  that a Scotchman born, though not bred, should become, after the effects
  of an English education and residence had efficiently done their work
  upon him, a great improver and enricher of the English tongue.</p>

  <p>But perhaps the strongest and most decisive argument of all in this
  much-vexed controversy is to be found in the panegyric of James the
  Fourth contained in the "Ship of Fools," an eulogy so highly pitched and
  extravagant that no Englishman of that time would ever have dreamed of it
  or dared to pen it. Nothing could well be more conclusive. Barclay
  precedes it by a long and high-flown tribute to Henry, but when he comes
  to "Jamys of Scotlonde," he, so to speak, out-Herods Herod. Ordinary
  verse suffices not for the greatness of his subject, which he must needs
  honour with an acrostic,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp;I n prudence pereles is this moste comely kynge</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There, we are convinced, speaks not the prejudiced, Scot-hating
  English critic, but the heart beating true to its fatherland and loyal to
  its native Sovereign.</p>

  <p>That "he was born beyonde the cold river of Twede," about the year
  1476, as shall be shown anon, is however all the length we can go. His
  training was without doubt mainly, if not entirely English. He must have
  crossed the border very early in life, probably for the purpose of
  pursuing his education at one of the Universities, or, even earlier than
  the period of his University career, with parents or guardians to reside
  in the neighbourhood of Croydon, to which he frequently refers. Croydon
  is mentioned in the following passages in Eclogue I.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"While I in youth in Croidon towne did dwell."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It seems to have become a second home to him, for there, we find, in
  1552, he died and was buried.</p>

  <p>At which University he studied, whether Oxford or Cambridge, is also a
  matter of doubt and controversy. Wood claims him for Oxford and Oriel,
  apparently on no other ground than that he dedicates the "Ship of Fools"
  to Thomas Cornish, the Suffragan bishop of Tyne, in the Diocese of Bath
  and Wells, who was provost of Oriel College from 1493 to 1507. That the
  Bishop was the first to give him an appointment in the Church is
  certainly a circumstance of considerable weight in favour of the claim of
  Oxford to be his <i>alma mater</i>, and of Cornish to be his intellectual
  father; and if the appointment proceeded from the Provost's good opinion
  of the young Scotchman, then it says much for the ability and talents
  displayed by him during his College career. Oxford however appears to be
  nowhere mentioned in his various writings, while Cambridge is introduced
  thus in Eclogue I.:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And once in Cambridge I heard a scoller say."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From which it seems equally, if not more, probable that he was a
  student at that university. "There is reason to believe that both the
  universities were frequented by Scotish students; many particular names
  are to be traced in their annals; nor is it altogether irrelevant to
  mention that Chaucer's young clerks of Cambridge who played such tricks
  to the miller of Trompington, are described as coming from the north, and
  as speaking the Scotish language:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'John highte that on, and Alein highte that other,</p>
      <p>Of o toun were they born that highte Strother,</p>
      <p>Fer in the North, I cannot tellen where.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"It may be considered as highly probable that Barclay completed his
  studies in one of those universities, and that the connections which he
  thus had an opportunity of forming, induced him to fix his residence in
  the South; and when we suppose him to have enjoyed the benefit of an
  English education it need not appear peculiarly 'strange, that in those
  days, a Scot should obtain so great reputation in England.'" (Irving,
  Hist. of Scot. Poetry).</p>

  <p>In the "Ship" there is a chapter "Of unprofytable Stody" in which he
  makes allusion to his student life in such a way as to imply that it had
  not been a model of regularity and propriety:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The great foly, the pryde, and the enormyte</p>
      <p>Of our studentis, and theyr obstynate errour</p>

      <p>More than I fynde wrytyn in myne actoure</p>

      <p>Wherfor of this shyp syns I am gouernoure</p>
      <p>I dare be bolde myne owne vyce to repreue."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If these lines are meant to be accepted literally, which such
  confessions seldom are, it may be that he was advised to put a year or
  two's foreign travel between his University career, and his entrance into
  the Church. At any rate, for whatever reason, on leaving the University,
  where, as is indicated by the title of "Syr" prefixed to his name in his
  translation of Sallust, he had obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts,
  he travelled abroad, whether at his own charges, or in the company of a
  son of one of his patrons is not recorded, principally in Germany, Italy,
  and France, where he applied himself, with an unusual assiduity and
  success, to the acquirement of the languages spoken in those countries
  and to the study of their best authors. In the chapter "Of unprofytable
  Stody," above mentioned, which contains proof how well he at least had
  profited by study, he cites certain continental seats of university
  learning at each of which, there is indeed no improbability in supposing
  he may have remained for some time, as was the custom in those days:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"One rennyth to Almayne another vnto France</p>

      <p>To Cayne, to Tolows, Athenys, or Colayne."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Another reference to his travels and mode of travelling is found in
  the Eclogues. Whether he made himself acquainted with the English towns
  he enumerates before or after his continental travels it is impossible to
  determine:</p>

  </div>
  <p>Returning to England, after some years of residence abroad, with his
  mind broadened and strengthened by foreign travel, and by the study of
  the best authors, modern as well as ancient, Barclay entered the church,
  the only career then open to a man of his training. With intellect,
  accomplishments, and energy possessed by few, his progress to distinction
  and power ought to have been easy and rapid, but it turned out quite
  otherwise. The road to eminence lay by the "backstairs," the atmosphere
  of which he could not endure. The ways of courtiers&mdash;falsehood,
  flattery, and fawning&mdash;he detested, and worse, he said so, wherefore
  his learning, wit and eloquence found but small reward. To his freedom of
  speech, his unsparing exposure and denunciation of corruption and vice in
  the Court and the Church, as well as among the people generally, must
  undoubtedly be attributed the failure to obtain that high promotion his
  talents deserved, and would otherwise have met with. The policy, not
  always a successful one in the end, of ignoring an inconvenient display
  of talent, appears to have been fully carried out in the instance of
  Barclay.</p>

  <p>His first preferment appears to have been in the shape of a
  chaplainship in the sanctuary for piety and learning founded at Saint
  Mary Otery in the County of Devon, by Grandison, Bishop of Exeter; and to
  have come from Thomas Cornish, Suffragan Bishop of Bath and Wells under
  the title of the Bishop of Tyne, "meorum primitias laborum qui in lucem
  eruperunt," to whom, doubtless out of gratitude for his first
  appointment, he dedicated "The Ship of Fools." Cornish, amongst the many
  other good things he enjoyed, held, according to Dugdale, from 1490 to
  1511, the post of warden of the College of S. Mary Otery, where Barclay
  no doubt had formed that regard and respect for him which is so strongly
  expressed in the dedication.</p>

  <p>A very eulogistic notice of "My Mayster Kyrkham," in the chapter "Of
  the extorcion of Knyghtis," (Ship of Fools,) has misled biographers, who
  were ignorant of Cornish's connection with S. Mary Otery, to imagine that
  Barclay's use of "Capellanus humilimus" in his dedication was merely a
  polite expression, and that Kyrkham, of whom he styles himself, "His true
  seruytour his chaplayne and bedeman" was his actual ecclesiastical
  superior. The following is the whole passage:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Good offycers ar good and commendable</p>
      <p>And manly knyghtes that lyue in rightwysenes</p>
      <p>But they that do nat ar worthy of a bable</p>
      <p>Syns by theyr pryde pore people they oppres</p>
      <p>My mayster Kyrkhan for his perfyte mekenes</p>
      <p>And supportacion of men in pouertye</p>
      <p>Out of my shyp shall worthely be fre</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I flater nat I am his true seruytour</p>
      <p>His chaplayne and his bede man whyle my lyfe shall endure</p>
      <p>Requyrynge God to exalt hym to honour</p>
      <p>And of his Prynces fauour to be sure</p>
      <p>For as I haue sayd I knowe no creature</p>
      <p>More manly rightwyse wyse discrete and sad</p>
      <p>But thoughe he be good, yet other ar als bad."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That this Kyrkham was a knight and not an ecclesiastic is so plainly
  apparent as to need no argument. An investigation into Devonshire history
  affords the interesting information that among the ancient families of
  that county there was one of this name, of great antiquity and repute,
  now no longer existent, of which the most eminent member was a certain
  Sir John Kirkham, whose popularity is evinced by his having been twice
  created High Sheriff of the County, in the years 1507 and 1523. (Prince,
  Worthies of Devon; Izacke, Antiquities of Exeter.)</p>

  <p>That this was the Kirkham above alluded to, there can be no reasonable
  doubt, and in view of the expression "My mayster Kyrkham," it may be
  surmised that Barclay had the honour of being appointed by this worthy
  gentleman to the office of Sheriff's or private Chaplain or to some
  similar position of confidence, by which he gained the poet's respect and
  gratitude. The whole allusion, however, might, without straining be
  regarded as a merely complimentary one. The tone of the passage affords
  at any rate a very pleasing glimpse of the mutual regard entertained by
  the poet and his Devonshire neighbours.</p>

  <p>After the eulogy of Kyrkham ending with "Yet other ar als bad," the
  poet goes on immediately to give the picture of a character of the
  opposite description, making the only severe personal reference in his
  whole writings, for with all his unsparing exposure of wrong-doing, he
  carefully, wisely, honourably avoided personality. A certain Mansell of
  Otery is gibbeted as a terror to evil doers in a way which would form a
  sufficient ground for an action for libel in these degenerate
  days.&mdash;Ship, II. 82.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Mansell of Otery for powlynge of the pore</p>
      <p>Were nat his great wombe, here sholde haue an ore</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>But for his body is so great and corporate</p>

      <p>About our shyp to spye about for prayes</p>
      <p>For therupon hath he lyued all his dayes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It ought however to be mentioned that no such name as Mansell appears
  in the Devonshire histories, and it may therefore be fictitious.</p>

  <p>The ignorance and reckless living of the clergy, one of the chief
  objects of his animadversion, receive also local illustration:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For if one can flater, and beare a Hauke on his fist,</p>
      <p>He shalbe <span class="correction" title="'mde' in original">made</span> parson of Honington or Clist."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A good humoured reference to the Secondaries of the College is the
  only other streak of local colouring we have detected in the Ship, except
  the passage in praise of his friend and colleague Bishop, quoted at p.
  liii.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Softe, fooles, softe, a little slacke your pace,</p>

      <p>Nothing they can, yet nought will they learne nor see,</p>
      <p>Therfore shall they guide this our ship of fooles."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the comfort, quiet, and seclusion of the pleasant Devonshire
  retreat, the "Ship" was translated in the year 1508, when he would be
  about thirty-two, "by Alexander Barclay Preste; and at that tyme chaplen
  in the sayde College," whence it may be inferred that he left Devon,
  either in that year or the year following, when the "Ship" was published,
  probably proceeding to London for the purpose of seeing it through the
  press. Whether he returned to Devonshire we do not know; probably not,
  for his patron and friend Cornish resigned the wardenship of St Mary
  Otery in 1511, and in two years after died, so that Barclay's ties and
  hopes in the West were at an end. At any rate we next hear of him in
  monastic orders, a monk of the order of S. Benedict, in the famous
  monastery of Ely, where, as is evident from internal proof, the Eclogues
  were written and where likewise, as appears from the title, was
  translated "The mirrour of good maners," at the desire of Syr Giles
  Alington, Knight.</p>

  <p>It is about this period of his life, probably the period of the full
  bloom of his popularity, that the quiet life of the poet and priest was
  interrupted by the recognition of his eminence in the highest quarters,
  and by a request for his aid in maintaining the honour of the country on
  an occasion to which the eyes of all Europe were then directed. In a
  letter of Sir Nicholas Vaux, busied with the preparations for the meeting
  of Henry VIII., and Francis I., called the Field of the Cloth of Gold, to
  Wolsey, of date 10th April 1520, he begs the cardinal to "send to them
  ... Maistre Barkleye, the Black Monke and Poete, to devise histoires and
  convenient raisons to florisshe the buildings and banquet house withal"
  (Rolls Calendars of Letters and Papers, Henry VIII., <span
  class="sc">iii.</span> pt. 1.). No doubt it was also thought that this
  would be an excellent opportunity for the eulogist of the Defender of the
  Faith to again take up the lyre to sing the glories of his royal master,
  but no effort of his muse on the subject of this great chivalric pageant
  has descended to us if any were ever penned.</p>

  <p>Probably after this employment he did not return to Ely; with his
  position or surroundings there he does not seem to have been altogether
  satisfied ("there many a thing is wrong," see p. lxix.); and afterwards,
  though in the matter of date we are somewhat puzzled by the allusion of
  Bulleyn, an Ely man, to his Franciscan habit, he assumed the habit of the
  Franciscans at Canterbury, ('Bale MS. Sloan, f. 68,') to which change we
  may owe, if it be really Barclay's, "The life of St Thomas of
  Canterbury."</p>

  <p>Autumn had now come to the poet, but fruit had failed him. The advance
  of age and his failure to obtain a suitable position in the Church began
  gradually to weigh upon his spirits. The bright hopes with which he had
  started in the flush of youth, the position he was to obtain, the
  influence he was to wield, and the work he was to do personally, and by
  his writings, in the field of moral and social reformation were all in
  sad contrast with the actualities around. He had never risen from the
  ranks, the army was in a state of disorganisation, almost of mutiny, and
  the enemy was more bold, unscrupulous, and numerous than ever. It is
  scarcely to be wondered at that, though not past fifty, he felt
  prematurely aged, that his youthful enthusiasm which had carried him on
  bravely in many an attempt to instruct and benefit his fellows at length
  forsook him and left him a prey to that weakness of body, and that
  hopelessness of spirit to which he so pathetically alludes in the
  Prologue to the Mirror of good Manners. All his best work, all the work
  which has survived to our day, was executed before this date. But the pen
  was too familiar to his hand to be allowed to drop. His biographers tell
  us "that when years came on he spent his time mostly in pious matters,
  and in reading and writing histories of the Saints." A goodly picture of
  a well-spent old age. The harness of youth he had no longer the spirit
  and strength to don, the garments of age he gathered resignedly and
  gracefully about him.</p>

  <p>On the violent dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, when their
  inmates, the good and bad, the men of wisdom and the "fools," were alike
  cast adrift upon a rock-bound and stormy coast, the value of the
  patronage which his literary and personal popularity had brought him, was
  put to the test, and in the end successfully, though after considerable,
  but perhaps not to be wondered at, delay. His great patrons, the Duke of
  Norfolk, the Earl of Kent, Bishop Cornish, and probably also Sir Giles
  Alington, were all dead, and he had to rely on newer and necessarily
  weaker ties. But after waiting, till probably somewhat dispirited,
  fortune smiled at last. Two handsome livings were presented to him in the
  same year, both of which he apparently held at the same time, the
  vicarage of Much Badew in Essex, by the presentation of Mr John Pascal,
  to which he was instituted on February 7th, 1546, holding it (according
  to the Lansdowne MS. (980 f. 101), in the British Museum) till his death;
  and the vicarage of S. Mathew at Wokey, in Somerset, on March 30th of the
  same year. Wood dignifies him with the degree of doctor of divinity at
  the time of his presentation to these preferments.</p>

  <p>That he seems to have accepted quietly the gradual progress of the
  reformed religion during the reign of Edward VI., has been a cause of
  wonder to some. It would certainly have been astonishing had one who was
  so unsparing in his exposure of the flagrant abuses of the Romish Church
  done otherwise. Though personally disinclined to radical changes his
  writings amply show his deep dissatisfaction with things as they were.
  This renders the more improbable the honours assigned him by Wadding
  (Scriptores Ordinis Minorum, 1806, p. 5), who promotes him to be
  Suffragan Bishop of Bath and Wells, and Bale, who, in a slanderous
  anecdote, the locale of which is also Wells, speaks of him as a chaplain
  of Queen Mary's, though Mary did not ascend the throne till the year
  after his death. As these statements are nowhere confirmed, it is not
  improbable that their authors have fallen into error by confounding the
  poet Barclay, with a Gilbert Berkeley, who became Bishop of Bath and
  Wells in 1559. One more undoubted, but tardy, piece of preferment was
  awarded him which may be regarded as an honour of some significance. On
  the 30th April 1552, the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, London,
  presented him to the Rectory of All Hallows, Lombard Street, but the
  well-deserved promotion came too late to be enjoyed. A few weeks after,
  and before the 10th June, at which date his will was proved, he died, as
  his biographers say, "at a very advanced age;" at the good old age of
  seventy-six, as shall be shown presently, at Croydon where he had passed
  his youth, and there in the Church he was buried. "June 10th 1552,
  Alexander Barkley sepult," (Extract from the Parish Register, in Lyson's
  Environs of London).</p>

  <p>A copy of his will, an extremely interesting and instructive document,
  has been obtained from Doctors' Commons, and will be found appended. It
  bears in all its details those traits of character which, from all that
  we otherwise know, we are led to associate with him. In it we see the
  earnest, conscientious minister whose first thought is of the poor, the
  loyal churchman liberal in his support of the house of God, the kind
  relative in his numerous and considerate bequests to his kith and kin,
  the amiable, much loved man in the gifts of remembrance to his many
  friends, and the pious Christian in his wishes for the prayers of his
  survivors "to Almightie God for remission of my synnes, and mercy upon my
  soule."</p>

  <p>Barclay's career and character, both as a churchman and a man of
  letters, deserve attention and respect from every student of our early
  history and literature. In the former capacity he showed himself
  diligent, honest, and anxious, at a time when these qualities seemed to
  have been so entirely lost to the church as to form only a subject for
  clerical ridicule. In the latter, the same qualities are also prominent,
  diligence, honesty, bold outspokenness, an ardent desire for the pure,
  the true, and the natural, and an undisguised enmity to everything false,
  self-seeking, and vile. Everything he did was done in a pure way, and to
  a worthy end.</p>

  <p>Bale stands alone in casting aspersions upon his moral character,
  asserting, as Ritson puts it, "in his bigoted and foul-mouthed way," that
  "he continued a hater of truth, and under the disguise of celibacy a
  filthy adulterer to the last;" and in his Declaration of Bonner's
  articles (1561, fol. 81), he condescends to an instance to the effect
  that "Doctoure Barkleye hadde greate harme ones of suche a visitacion, at
  Wellys, before he was Quene Maryes Chaplayne. For the woman whome he so
  religiouslye visited did light him of all that he had, sauinge his
  workinge tolas. For the whiche acte he had her in prison, and yet coulde
  nothing recouer againe." Whether this story be true of any one is perhaps
  doubtful, and, if true of a Barclay, we are convinced that he is not our
  author. It may have arisen as we have seen from a mistake as to <span
  class="correction" title="'indentity' in original">identity.</span> But
  apart from the question of identity, we have nothing in support of the
  slander but Bale's "foul-mouthed" assertion, while against it we have the
  whole tenor and aim of Barclay's published writings. Everywhere he
  inculcates the highest and purest morality, and where even for that
  purpose he might be led into descriptions of vice, his disgust carries
  him past what most others would have felt themselves justified in dealing
  with. For example, in the chapter of "Disgysyd folys" he expressly passes
  over as lightly as possible what might to others have proved a tempting
  subject:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"They disceyue myndes chaste and innocent</p>
      <p>With dyuers wayes whiche I wyll nat expres</p>
      <p>Lyst that whyle I labour this cursyd gyse to stynt</p>
      <p>I myght to them mynyster example of lewdnes</p>
      <p>And therfore in this part I shall say les</p>
      <p>Than doth my actour."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Elsewhere he declares:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16">"for my boke certaynly</p>
      <p>I haue compyled: for vertue and goodnes</p>
      <p>And to reuyle foule synne and vyciousnes"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But citation is needless; there is not a page of his writings which
  will not supply similar evidence, and our great early moralist may, we
  think, be dismissed from Court without a stain on his character.</p>

  <p>Indeed to his high pitched morality, he doubtless owed in some degree
  the great and extended popularity of his poetical writings in former
  times and their neglect in later. Sermons and "good" books were not yet
  in the sixteenth century an extensive branch of literature, and "good"
  people could without remorse of conscience vary their limited theological
  reading by frowning over the improprieties and sins of their neighbours
  as depicted in the "Ship," and joining, with a serious headshaking
  heartiness, in the admonitions of the translator to amendment, or they
  might feel "strengthened" by a glance into the "Mirrour of good Maners,"
  or edified by hearing of the "Miseryes of Courtiers and Courtes of all
  princes in generall," as told in the "Eclogues."</p>

  <p>Certain it is that these writings owed little of their acceptance to
  touches of humour or satire, to the gifts of a poetical imagination, or
  the grace of a polished diction. The indignation of the honest man and
  the earnestness of the moralist waited not for gifts and graces.
  Everything went down, hard, rough, even uncouth as it stood, of course
  gaining in truth and in graphic power what it wants in elegance. Still,
  with no refinement, polish or elaboration, there are many picturesque
  passages scattered throughout these works which no amount of polishing
  could have improved. How could a man in a rage be better touched off than
  thus ("Ship" I. 182, 15).</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This man malycious whiche troubled is with wrath</p>
      <p>Nought els soundeth but the hoorse letter R."</p>

  </div>
  <p>The passion of love is so graphically described that it is difficult
  to imagine our priestly moralist a total stranger to its power, (I.
  81).</p>

  </div>
  <p>It is as the graphic delineator of the life and condition of the
  country in his period that the chief interest of Barclay's writings, and
  especially of the "Ship of Fools," now lies. Nowhere so accessibly, so
  fully, and so truthfully will be found the state of Henry the Eighth's
  England set forth. Every line bears the character of truthfulness,
  written as it evidently is, in all the soberness of sadness, by one who
  had no occasion to exaggerate, whose only object and desire was, by
  massing together and describing faithfully the follies and abuses which
  were evident to all, to shame every class into some degree of moral
  reformation, and, in particular, to effect some amelioration of
  circumstances to the suffering poor.</p>

  <p>And a sad picture it is which we thus obtain of merrie England in the
  good old times of bluff King Hal, wanting altogether in the <i>couleur de
  rose</i> with which it is tinted by its latest historian Mr Froude, who
  is ably taken to task on this subject by a recent writer in the
  Westminster Review, whose conclusions, formed upon other evidence than
  Barclay's, express so fairly the impression left by a perusal of the
  "Ship of Fools," and the Eclogues, that we quote them here. "Mr Froude
  remarks: 'Looking therefore, at the state of England as a whole, I cannot
  doubt that under Henry the body of the people were prosperous, well-fed,
  loyal, and contented. In all points of material comfort, they were as
  well off as ever they had been before; better off than they have ever
  been in later times.' In this estimate we cannot agree. Rather we should
  say that during, and for long after, this reign, the people were in the
  most deplorable condition of poverty and misery of every kind. That they
  were ill-fed, that loyalty was at its lowest ebb, that discontent was
  rife throughout the land. 'In all points of material comfort,' we think
  they were worse off than they had ever been before, and infinitely worse
  off than they have ever been since the close of the sixteenth
  century,&mdash;a century in which the cup of England's woes was surely
  fuller than it has ever been since, or will, we trust, ever be again. It
  was the century in which this country and its people passed through a
  baptism of blood as well as 'a baptism of fire,' and out of which they
  came holier and better. The epitaph which should be inscribed over the
  century is contained in a sentence written by the famous Acham in
  1547:&mdash;'Nam vita, quæ nunc vivitur a plurimis, non vita sed miseria
  est.'" So, Bradford (Sermon on Repentance, 1533) sums up contemporary
  opinion in a single weighty sentence: "All men may see if they will that
  the whoredom pride, unmercifulness, and tyranny of England far surpasses
  any age that ever was before." Every page of Barclay corroborates these
  accounts of tyranny, injustice, immorality, wretchedness, poverty, and
  general discontent.</p>

  <p>Not only in fact and feeling are Barclay's Ship of Fools and Eclogues
  thoroughly expressive of the unhappy, discontented, poverty-stricken,
  priest-ridden, and court-ridden condition and life, the bitter sorrows
  and the humble wishes of the people, their very texture, as Barclay
  himself tells us, consists of the commonest language of the day, and in
  it are interwoven many of the current popular proverbs and expressions.
  Almost all of these are still "household words" though few ever imagine
  the garb of their "daily wisdom" to be of such venerable antiquity. Every
  page of the "Eclogues" abounds with them; in the "Ship" they are less
  common, but still by no means infrequent. We have for
  instance:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The following are selected from the Eclogues as the most
  remarkable:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Each man for himself, and the fende for us all."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"They robbe Saint Peter therwith to clothe Saint Powle."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"For might of water will not our leasure bide."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"Once out of sight and shortly out of minde."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"For children brent still after drede the fire."</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Over head and eares."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"Go to the ant."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"A man may contende, God geueth victory."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"Of two evils chose the least."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These are but the more striking specimens. An examination of the
  "Ship," and especially of the "Eclogues," for the purpose of extracting
  their whole proverbial lore, would be well worth the while, if it be not
  the duty, of the next collector in this branch of popular literature.
  These writings introduce many of our common sayings for the first time to
  English literature, no writer prior to Barclay having thought it
  dignified or worth while to profit by the popular wisdom to any
  perceptible extent. The first collection of proverbs, Heywood's, did not
  appear until 1546, so that in Barclay we possess the earliest known
  English form of such proverbs as he introduces. It need scarcely be said
  that that form is, in the majority of instances, more full of meaning and
  point than its modern representatives.</p>

  <p>Barclay's adoption of the language of the people naturally elevated
  him in popular estimation to a position far above that of his
  contemporaries in the matter of style, so much so that he has been
  traditionally recorded as one of the greatest improvers of the language,
  that is, one of those who helped greatly to bring the written language to
  be more nearly in accordance with the spoken. Both a scholar and a man of
  the world, his phraseology bears token of the greater cultivation and
  wider knowledge he possessed over his contemporaries. He certainly aimed
  at clearness of expression, and simplicity of vocabulary, and in these
  respects was so far in advance of his time that his works can even now be
  read with ease, without the help of dictionary or glossary. In spite of
  his church training and his residence abroad, his works are surprisingly
  free from Latin or French forms of speech; on the contrary, they are, in
  the main, characterised by a strong Saxon directness of expression which
  must have tended greatly to the continuance of their popularity, and have
  exercised a strong and advantageous influence both in regulating the use
  of the common spoken language, and in leading the way which it was
  necessary for the literary language to follow. Philologists and
  dictionary makers appear, however, to have hitherto overlooked Barclay's
  works, doubtless owing to their rarity, but their intrinsic value as well
  as their position in relation to the history of the language demand
  specific recognition at their hands.</p>

  <p>Barclay evidently delighted in his pen. From the time of his return
  from the Continent, it was seldom out of his hand. Idleness was
  distasteful to him. He petitions his critics if they be "wyse men and
  cunnynge," that:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"They shall my youth pardone, and vnchraftynes</p>
      <p>Whiche onely translate, to eschewe ydelnes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Assuredly a much more laudable way of employing leisure then than now,
  unless the translator prudently stop short of print. The modesty and
  singleness of aim of the man are strikingly illustrated by his thus
  devoting his time and talents, not to original work as he was well able
  to have done had he been desirous only of glorifying his own name, but to
  the translation and adaptation or, better, "Englishing" of such foreign
  authors as he deemed would exercise a wholesome and profitable influence
  upon his countrymen. Such work, however, moulded in his skilful hands,
  became all but original, little being left of his author but the idea.
  Neither the Ship of Fools, nor the Eclogues retain perceptible traces of
  a foreign source, and were it not that they honestly bear their
  authorship on their fore-front, they might be regarded as thoroughly,
  even characteristically, English productions.</p>

  <p>The first known work from Barclay's pen<a name="Ft_3"
  href="#FtN_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> appeared from the press of De Worde, so
  early as 1506, probably immediately on his return from abroad, and was no
  doubt the fruit of continental leisure. It is a translation, in seven
  line stanzas, of the popular French poet Pierre Gringore's Le Chateau de
  labour (1499)&mdash;the most ancient work of Gringore with date, and
  perhaps his best&mdash;under the title of "The Castell of laboure wherein
  is richesse, vertu, and honour;" in which in a fanciful allegory of some
  length, a somewhat wearisome Lady Reason overcomes despair, poverty and
  other such evils attendant upon the fortunes of a poor man lately
  married, the moral being to show:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That idleness, mother of all adversity,</p>
      <p>Her subjects bringeth to extreme poverty."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The general appreciation of this first essay is evidenced by the issue
  of a second edition from the press of Pynson a few years after the
  appearance of the first.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by the favourable reception accorded to the first effort of
  his muse, Barclay, on his retirement to the ease and leisure of the
  College of St Mary Otery, set to work on the "Ship of Fools,"
  acquaintance with which Europe-famous satire he must have made when
  abroad. This, his <i>magnum opus</i>, has been described at some length
  in the Introduction, but two interesting personal notices relative to the
  composition of the work may here be added. In the execution of the great
  task, he expresses himself, (II. 278), as under the greatest obligations
  to his colleague, friend, and literary adviser, Bishop:&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Pynson, in his capacity of judicious publisher, fearing lest the book
  should exceed suitable dimensions, also receives due notice at p. 108 of
  Vol. I., where he speaks of</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>The concluding stanza, or colophon, is also devoted to immortalising
  the great bibliopole in terms, it must be admitted, not dissimilar to
  those of a modern draper's poet laureate:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Contemporary allusions to the Ship of Fools there could not fail to
  be, but the only one we have met with occurs in Bulleyn's Dialogue quoted
  above, p. xxvii. It runs as follows:&mdash;<i>Uxor</i>.&mdash;What ship
  is that with so many owers, and straunge tacle; it is a greate vessell.
  <i>Ciuis</i>.&mdash;This is the ship of fooles, wherin saileth bothe
  spirituall and temporall, of euery callyng some: there are kynges,
  queenes, popes, archbishoppes, prelates, lordes, ladies, knightes,
  gentlemen, phisicions, lawiers, marchauntes, housbandemen, beggers,
  theeues, hores, knaues, &amp;c. This ship wanteth a good pilot: the
  storme, the rocke, and the wrecke at hande, all will come to naught in
  this hulke for want of good gouernement.</p>

  <p>The Eclogues, as appears from their Prologue, had originally been the
  work of our author's youth, "the essays of a prentice in the art of
  poesie," but they were wisely laid past to be adorned by the wisdom of a
  wider experience, and were, strangely enough, lost for years until, at
  the age of thirty-eight, the author again lighted, unexpectedly, upon his
  lost treasures, and straightway finished them off for the public eye.</p>

  <p>The following autobiographical passage reminds one forcibly of Scott's
  throwing aside Waverley, stumbling across it after the lapse of years,
  and thereupon deciding at once to finish and publish it. After
  enumerating the most famous eclogue writers, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nowe to my purpose, their workes worthy fame,</p>
      <p>Did in my yonge age my heart greatly inflame,</p>
      <p>Dull slouth eschewing my selfe to exercise,</p>
      <p>In such small matters, or I durst enterprise,</p>
      <p>To hyer matter, like as these children do,</p>

      <p>So where I in youth a certayne worke began,</p>
      <p>And not concluded, as oft doth many a man:</p>
      <p>Yet thought I after to make the same perfite,</p>
      <p>But long I missed that which I first did write.</p>
      <p>But here a wonder, I fortie yere saue twayne,</p>
      <p>Proceeded in age, founde my first youth agayne.</p>
      <p>To finde youth in age is a probleme diffuse,</p>
      <p>But nowe heare the truth, and then no longer muse.</p>
      <p>As I late turned olde bookes to and fro,</p>
      <p>One litle treatise I founde among the mo</p>
      <p>Because that in youth I did compile the same,</p>
      <p>Egloges of youth I did call it by name.</p>
      <p>And seing some men haue in the same delite,</p>
      <p>At their great instance I made the same perfite,</p>
      <p>Adding and bating where I perceyued neede,</p>
      <p>All them desiring which shall this treatise rede,</p>
      <p>Not to be grieued with any playne sentence,</p>
      <p>Rudely conuayed for lacke of eloquence."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The most important revelation in the whole of this interesting
  passage, that relating to the author's age, seems to have been studiously
  overlooked by all his biographers. If we can fix with probability the
  date at which these Eclogues were published, then this, one of the most
  regretted of the lacunæ in his biography, will be supplied. We shall feel
  henceforth treading on firmer ground in dealing with the scanty materials
  of his life.</p>

  <p>From the length and favour with which the praises of the Ely Cathedral
  and of Alcock its pious and munificent bishop, then but recently dead,
  are sung in these poems (see p. lxviii.), it is evident that the poet
  must have donned the black hood in the monastery of Ely for at least a
  few years.</p>

  <p>Warton fixes the date at 1514, because of the praises of the "noble
  Henry which now departed late," and the after panegyric of his successor
  Henry VIII. (Eclogue I.), whose virtues are also duly recorded in the
  Ship of Fools (I. 39 and II. 205-8), but not otherwise of course than in
  a complimentary manner. Our later lights make this picture of the noble
  pair appear both out of drawing and over-coloured:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>This eulogy of Henry plainly implies some short experience of his
  reign. But other allusions contribute more definitely to fix the precise
  date, such as the following historical passage, which evidently refers to
  the career of the notorious extortioners, Empson and Dudley, who were
  executed for conspiracy and treason in the first year of the new king's
  reign.</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>The most definite proof of the date of publication, however, is found
  in the fourth Eclogue. It contains a long poem called The towre of vertue
  and honour, which is really a highly-wrought elegy on the premature and
  glorious death, not of "the Duke of Norfolk, Lord High admiral, and one
  of Barclay's patrons," as has been repeated parrot-like, from Warton
  downwards, but of his chivalrous son, Sir Edward Howard, Lord High
  Admiral for the short space of a few months, who perished in his gallant,
  if reckless, attack upon the French fleet in the harbour of Brest in the
  year 1513. It is incomprehensible that the date of the publication of the
  Eclogues should be fixed at 1514, and this blunder still perpetuated. No
  Duke of Norfolk died between Barclay's boyhood and 1524, ten years after
  the agreed upon date of the Elegy; and the Duke (Thomas), who was
  Barclay's patron, never held the position of Lord High Admiral (though
  his son Lord Thomas, created Earl of Surrey in 1514, and who afterwards
  succeeded him, also succeeded his brother Sir Edward in the Admiralship),
  but worthily enjoyed the dignified offices of Lord High Steward, Lord
  Treasurer, and Earl Marshal, and died one of Henry's most respected and
  most popular Ministers, at his country seat, at a good old age, in the
  year above mentioned, 1524. The other allusions to contemporary events,
  and especially to the poet's age, preclude the idea of carrying forward
  the publication to the latter date, did the clearly defined points of the
  Elegy allow of it, as they do not.</p>

  <p>Minalcas, one of the interlocutors, thus introduces the
  subject:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'The Towre of Vertue and Honor,' introduced as a song of one of the
  shepherds into these pastorals, exhibits no very masterly strokes of a
  sublime and inventive fancy. It has much of the trite imagery usually
  applied in the fabrication of these ideal edifices. It, however, shows
  our author in a new walk of poetry. This magnificent tower, or castle is
  built on inaccessible cliffs of flint: the walls are of gold, bright as
  the sun, and decorated with 'olde historyes and pictures manyfolde:' the
  turrets are beautifully shaped. Among its heroic inhabitants are Henry
  VIII., ['in his maiestie moste hye enhaunsed as ought a conquerour,' no
  doubt an allusion to the battle of the Spurs and his other exploits in
  France in 1513], Howard Duke of Norfolk, ['the floure of chiualry'], and
  the Earl of Shrewsbury, ['manfull and hardy, with other princes and men
  of dignitie']. Labour is the porter at the gate, and Virtue governs the
  house. Labour is thus pictured, with some degree of spirit:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The poet adds, 'that when the noble Howard had long boldly contended
  with this hideous monster, had broken the bars and doors of the castle,
  had bound the porter, and was now preparing to ascend the tower of Virtue
  and Honour, Fortune and Death appeared, and interrupted his progress.'"

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The poet, gives "cursed fortune" a severe rating, and at such length
  that the old lady no doubt repented herself, for cutting off so promising
  a hero <i>at so early an age</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

  </div>
  <p>This detail and these long quotations have been rendered necessary by
  the strange blunder which has been made and perpetuated as to the
  identity of the young hero whose death is so feelingly lamented in this
  elegy. With that now clearly ascertained, we can not only fix with
  confidence the date of the publication of the Eclogues, but by aid of the
  hint conveyed in the Prologue, quoted above (p. lv.), as to the author's
  age, "fortie saue twayne," decide, for the first time, the duration of
  his life, and the dates, approximately at least, of its incidents, and of
  the appearance of his undated works. Lord Edward Howard, perhaps the
  bravest and rashest of England's admirals, perished in a madly daring
  attack upon the harbour of Brest, on the 25th of April, 1514. As the
  eclogues could not therefore have been published prior to that date, so,
  bearing in mind the other allusions referred to above, they could
  scarcely have appeared later. Indeed, the loss which the elegy
  commemorates is spoken of as quite recent, while the elegy itself bears
  every appearance of having been introduced into the eclogue at the last
  moment. We feel quite satisfied therefore that Warton hit quite correctly
  upon the year 1514 as that in which these poems first saw the light,
  though the ground (the allusion to the Henries) upon which he went was
  insufficient, and his identification of the hero of the elegy
  contradicted his supposition. Had he been aware of the importance of
  fixing the date correctly, he would probably have taken more care than to
  fall into the blunder of confounding the father with the son, and
  adorning the former with the dearly earned laurels of the latter.</p>

  <p>It may be added that, fixing 1514 as the date at which Barclay had
  arrived at the age of 38, agrees perfectly with all else we know of his
  years, with the assumed date of his academical education, and of his
  travels abroad, with the suppositions formed as to his age from his
  various published works having dates attached to them, and finally, with
  the traditional "great age" at which he died, which would thus be six
  years beyond the allotted span.</p>

  <p>After the Ship of Fools the Eclogues rank second in importance in a
  consideration of Barclay's writings. Not only as the first of their kind
  in English, do they crown their author with the honour of introducing
  this kind of poetry to English literature, but they are in themselves
  most interesting and valuable as faithful and graphic pictures of the
  court, citizen, and country life of the period. Nowhere else in so
  accessible a form do there exist descriptions at once so full and so
  accurate of the whole condition of the people. Their daily life and
  habits, customs, manners, sports, and pastimes, are all placed on the
  canvas before us with a ready, vigorous, unflinching hand. Witness for
  instance the following sketch, which might be entitled, "Life, temp.
  1514":&mdash;</p>

  learned Alcock, Bishop of Ely (1486-1500), and the munificent founder of
  Jesus College, Cambridge, stands deservedly high in the esteem of a poet
  and priest, so zealous of good works as Barclay. The poet's humour thus
  disguises him.&mdash;(Eclogue I., A iii., recto.):&mdash;</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Yes since his dayes a cocke was in the fen,</p>
      <p>I knowe his voyce among a thousande men:</p>
      <p>He taught, he preached, he mended euery wrong;</p>
      <p>But, Coridon alas no good thing bideth long.</p>
      <p>He all was a cocke, he wakened vs from slepe,</p>
      <p>And while we slumbred, he did our foldes hepe.</p>
      <p>No cur, no foxes, nor butchers dogges wood,</p>
      <p>Coulde hurte our fouldes, his watching was so good.</p>
      <p>The hungry wolues, which that time did abounde,</p>
      <p>What time he crowed, abashed at the sounde.</p>
      <p>This cocke was no more abashed of the foxe,</p>
      <p>Than is a lion abashed of an oxe.</p>
      <p>When he went, faded the floure of all the fen;</p>
      <p>I boldly dare sweare this cocke neuer trode hen!</p>
      <p>This was a father of thinges pastorall,</p>

      <p>There was I lately about the middest of May,</p>
      <p>Coridon his Church is twenty sith more gay</p>
      <p>Then all the Churches betwene the same and Kent,</p>
      <p>There sawe I his tome and Chapell excellent.</p>
      <p>I thought fiue houres but euen a little while,</p>
      <p>Saint John the virgin me thought did on me smile,</p>
      <p>Our parishe Church is but a dongeon,</p>
      <p>To that gay Churche in comparison.</p>
      <p>If the people were as pleasaunt as the place</p>
      <p>Then were it paradice of pleasour and solace,</p>
      <p>Then might I truely right well finde in my heart.</p>

      <p>Trust me Coridon there many a thing is wrong,</p>
      <p>When I sawe his figure lye in the Chapell-side,</p>
      <p>Like death for weping I might no longer bide.</p>

      <p>When the good is gone (my mate this is the case)</p>
      <p>Seldome the better reentreth in the place."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The excellence of his subject carries the poet quite beyond himself in
  describing the general lamentation at the death of this worthy prelate;
  with an unusual power of imagination he thus pictures the sympathy of the
  towers, arches, vaults and images of Ely monastery:</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Morton, Alcock's predecessor and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury
  (1486-1500), is also singled out for compliment, in which allusion is
  made to his troubles, his servants' faithfulness, and his restoration to
  favour under Richard III. and Henry VII. (Eclogue III.):&mdash;</p>

  </div>
  <p>The "Dean of Powles" (Colet), with whom Barclay seems to have been
  personally acquainted, and to whom the reference alludes as to one still
  living (his death occurred in 1519), is celebrated as a preacher in the
  same Eclogue:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For this I learned of the Dean of Powles</p>
      <p>I tell thee, Codrus this man hath won some soules."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>as is "the olde friar that wonned in Greenwich" in Eclogue V.</p>

  <p>The first three Eclogues are paraphrases or adaptations from the
  Miseriæ Curialium, the most popular of the works of one of the most
  successful literary adventurers of the middle ages, Æneas Sylvius (Pope
  Pius II., who died in 1464). It appears to have been written with the
  view of relieving his feelings of disappointment and disgust at his
  reception at the court of the Emperor, whither he had repaired, in the
  hope of political advancement. The tone and nature of the work may be
  gathered from this candid exposure of the adventurer's morale: "Many
  things there are which compel us to persevere, but nothing more
  powerfully than ambition which, rivalling charity, truly beareth all
  things however grievous, that it may attain to the honours of this world
  and the praise of men. If we were humble and laboured to gain our own
  souls rather than hunt after vain glory, few of us, indeed, would endure
  such annoyances." He details, with querulous humour, all the grievances
  of his position, from the ingratitude of the prince to the sordour of the
  table-cloths, and the hardness of the black bread. But hardest of all to
  bear is the contempt shown towards literature. "In the courts of princes
  literary knowledge is held a crime; and great is the grief of men of
  letters when they find themselves universally despised, and see the most
  important matters managed, not to say mismanaged, by blockheads, who
  cannot tell the number of their fingers and toes."</p>

  <p>Barclay's adaptation is so thoroughly Englished, and contains such
  large additions from the stores of his own bitter experience, as to make
  it even more truly his own than any other of his translations.</p>

  <p>The fourth and fifth eclogues are imitations,&mdash;though no notice
  that they are so is conveyed in the title, as in the case of the first
  three,&mdash;of the fifth and sixth of the popular eclogue writer of the
  time, Jo. Baptist Mantuan, which may have helped to give rise to the
  generally received statement noticed below, that all the eclogues are
  imitations of that author. The fourth is entitled "Codrus and Minalcas,
  treating of the behauour of Riche men agaynst Poetes," and it may be
  judged how far it is Barclay's from the fact that it numbers about twelve
  hundred lines, including the elegy of the Noble Howard, while the
  original, entitled, "De consuetudine Divitum erga Poetas," contains only
  about two hundred. The fifth is entitled "Amintas and Faustus, of the
  disputation of citizens and men of the countrey." It contains over a
  thousand lines, and the original, "De disceptatione rusticorum et
  civium," like the fifth, extends to little more than two hundred.</p>

  <p>In the Prologue before mentioned we are told (Cawood's
  edition):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That fiue Egloges this whole treatise doth holde</p>
      <p>To imitation of other Poetes olde,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Which appears to be a correction of the printer's upon the original,
  as in Powell's edition:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That X. egloges this hole treatyse dothe holde."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Whether other five were ever published there is no record to show; it
  appears, however, highly improbable, that, if they had, they could have
  been entirely lost,&mdash;especially considering the popularity and
  repeated issue of the first five,&mdash;during the few years that would
  have elapsed between their original publication and the appearance of
  Cawood's edition. Possibly the original reading may be a typographical
  blunder, for Cawood is extremely sparing of correction, and appears to
  have made none which he did not consider absolutely necessary. This is
  one of the literary puzzles which remain for bibliography to solve. (See
  below, p. lxxix.)</p>

  <p>The next of Barclay's works in point of date, and perhaps the only one
  actually entitled to the merit of originality, is his Introductory to
  write and pronounce French, compiled at the request of his great patron,
  Thomas Duke of Norfolk, and printed by Copland in 1521. It is thus
  alluded to in the first important authority on French grammar,
  "Lesclarissement de la langue Francoyse compose par maistre Jehan
  Palsgraue, Angloys, natyf de Londres," 1530: "The right vertuous and
  excellent prince Thomas, late Duke of Northfolke, hath commanded the
  studious clerke, Alexandre Barkelay, to embusy hymselfe about this
  exercyse." Further on he is not so complimentary as he
  remarks:&mdash;"Where as there is a boke, that goeth about in this
  realme, intitled The introductory to writte and pronounce frenche,
  compiled by Alexander Barcley, in which k is moche vsed, and many other
  thynges also by hym affirmed, contrary to my sayenges in this boke, and
  specially in my seconde, where I shall assaye to expresse the
  declinations and coniugatynges with the other congruites obserued in the
  frenche tonge, I suppose it sufficient to warne the lernar, that I haue
  red ouer that boke at length: and what myn opinion is therin, it shall
  well inough apere in my bokes selfe, though I make therof no ferther
  expresse mencion: saue that I haue sene an olde boke written in
  parchement, in maner in all thynkes like to his sayd Introductory:
  whiche, by coniecture, was not vnwritten this hundred yeres. I wot nat if
  he happened to fortune upon suche an other: for whan it was commaunded
  that the grammar maisters shulde teche the youth of Englande ioyntly
  latin with frenche, there were diuerse suche bokes diuysed: wherupon, as
  I suppose, began one great occasyon why we of England sounde the latyn
  tong so corruptly, whiche haue as good a tonge to sounde all maner
  speches parfitely as any other nacyon in Europa."&mdash;Book I. ch. xxxv.
  "According to this," Mr Ellis (Early English Pronunciation, 804)
  pertinently notes: "1º, there ought to be many old MS. treatises on
  French grammar; and 2º, the English pronunciation of Latin was moulded on
  the French."</p>

  <p>To Barclay, as nine years before Palsgrave, belongs at least the
  credit, hitherto generally unrecognised, of the first published attempt
  at a French grammar, by either Frenchman or foreigner.</p>

  <p>"The mirror of good manners, containing the four cardinal vertues,"
  appeared from the press of Pynson, without date, "which boke," says the
  typographer, "I haue prynted at the instance and request of the ryght
  noble Rychard Yerle of Kent." This earl of Kent died in 1523, and as
  Barclay speaks of himself in the preface as advanced in age, the date of
  publication may be assigned to close upon that year. It is a translation,
  in the ballad stanza, of the Latin elegiac poem of Dominicus Mancinus,
  <i>De quatuor virtutibus</i>, first published in 1516, and, as appears
  from the title, was executed while Barclay was a monk of Ely, at "the
  desire of the righte worshipfull Syr Giles Alington, Knight." From the
  address to his patron it would seem that the Knight had requested the
  poet to abridge or modernise Gower's Confessio amantis. For declining
  this task he pleads, that he is too old to undertake such a light
  subject, and also the sacred nature of his profession. He then intimates
  his choice of the present more grave and serious work instead&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Which a priest may write, not hurting his estate,</p>
      <p>Nor of honest name obumbring at all his light.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"But the poet," says Warton, "declined this undertaking as unsuitable
  to his age, infirmities, and profession, and chose rather to oblige his
  patron with a grave system of ethics. It is certain that he made a
  prudent choice. The performance shows how little qualified he was to
  correct Gower." Instead of a carping criticism like this, it would have
  been much more to the point to praise the modesty and sensibility of an
  author, who had the courage to decline a task unsuited to his tastes or
  powers.</p>

  <p>He professes little:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>This playne litle treatise in stile compendious,</p>
      <p>Much briefly conteyneth four vertues cardinall,</p>
      <p>In right pleasaunt processe, plaine and commodious,</p>
      <p>With light foote of metre, and stile heroicall,</p>
      <p>Rude people to infourme in language maternall,</p>
      <p>To whose vnderstanding maydens of tender age,</p>
      <p>And rude litle children shall finde easy passage.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Two editions of the work are sufficient evidence that this humble and
  praiseworthy purpose was, in the eyes of his contemporaries, successfully
  carried out.</p>

  <p>The only remaining authentic production of Barclay which has come down
  to us, is a translation of the Jugurthine War of Sallust, undertaken at
  the request of, and dedicated to, his great patron, Thomas Duke of
  Norfolk, and printed also at Pynson's press without date. The Latin and
  English are printed side by side on the same page, the former being
  dedicated, with the date "Ex cellula Hatfelde<span class="over">n</span>
  regii (<i>i.e.</i>, King's Hatfield, Hertfordshire) in Idus Novembris" to
  Vesey, the centenarian Bishop of Exeter, with this
  superscription:&mdash;"Reuer<span class="over">e</span>dissimo in Christo
  patri ac dn<span class="over">o</span>: dn<span class="over">o</span>
  Joanni Veysy exoni<span class="over">e</span>n episcopo Alexander Barclay
  presbyter debita cum obseruantia. S." The dedication begins, "Memini me
  superioribus annis c<span class="over">u</span> adhuc sacelli regij
  presul esses: pastor vigilantissime: tuis suasionibus incitat<span
  class="over">u</span>: vt Crispi Salustij hystori<span
  class="over">a</span>&mdash;e romana lingua: in anglicam compendiose
  transferrem," &amp;c. Vesey was probably one of Barclay's oldest west
  country friends; for he is recorded to have been connected with the
  diocese of Exeter from 1503 to 1551, in the various capacities of
  archdeacon, precentor, dean, and bishop successively. Conjecture has
  placed the date of this publication at 1511, but as Veysey did not
  succeed to the Bishopric of Exeter till August 1519, this is untenable.
  We cannot say more than that it must have been published between 1519 and
  1524, the date of the Duke of Norfolk's death, probably in the former
  year, since, from its being dated from "Hatfield," the ancient palace of
  the bishops of Ely, (sold to the Crown in the 30th of Henry VIII.;
  Clutterbuck's Hertfordshire, II.) Barclay at the time of its completion
  was evidently still a monk of Ely.</p>

  <p>By his translation of Sallust (so popular an author at that period,
  that the learned virgin queen is reported to have amused her leisure with
  an English version), Barclay obtained the distinction of being the first
  to introduce that classic to English readers. His version bears the
  reputation of being executed not only with accuracy, but with
  considerable freedom and elegance, and its popularity was evinced by its
  appearance in three additions.</p>

  <p>Two other works of our author are spoken of as having been in print,
  but they have apparently passed entirely out of sight: "The figure of our
  holy mother Church, oppressed by the Frenche King," (Pynson, 4to), known
  only from Maunsell's Catalogue; and "The lyfe of the glorious martyr,
  saynt George translated (from Mantuan) by Alexander Barclay, while he was
  a monk of Ely, and dedicated to N. West, Bishop of Ely," (Pynson, 4to),
  (Herbert, Typ. Antiquities.) West was Bishop of Ely from 1515 to 1533,
  and consequently Barclay's superior during probably his whole stay there.
  Whether these two works were in verse or prose is unknown.</p>

  <p>There are two other books ascribed to Barclay, but nothing
  satisfactory can be stated regarding their parentage except that,
  considering their subject, and the press they issued from, it is not at
  all unlikely that they may have been the fruit of his prolific pen. The
  first is "The lyfe of the blessed martyr, Saynte Thomas," in prose,
  printed by Pynson, (Herbert, Typ. Ant. 292), regarding which Ant. Wood
  says, "I should feel little difficulty in ascribing this to Barclay." The
  other is the English translation of the Histoire merveilleuse du Grand
  Khan (in Latin, De Tartaris siue Liber historiarum partium Orientis) of
  the eastern soldier, and western monk, Haytho, prince of Georgia at the
  end of the 13th, and beginning of the 14th centuries. The History which
  gives an account of Genghis Khan, and his successors, with a short
  description of the different kingdoms of Asia, was very popular in the
  15th and 16th centuries, as one of the earliest accounts of the East, and
  the conjecture of the Grenville Catalogue is not improbable, though there
  is no sufficient evidence, that Barclay was the author of the English
  version which appeared from the press of Pynson.</p>

  <p>Bale further enumerates in his list of Barclay's works "Contra
  Skeltonum, Lib. I.; Quinq: eglogas ex Mantuano, Lib. I; Vitam D.
  Catherinæ, Lib. I., [Libros tres, Pits]; Vitam D. Margaritæ, Lib. I.;
  Vitam Etheldredæ, Lib. I.; Aliaq: plura fecit." Tanner adds: "Orationes
  varias, Lib. I.; De fide orthodoxa, Lib. I."</p>

  <p>Of these various fruits of Barclay's fertility and industry no
  fragment has survived to our day, nor has even any positive information
  regarding their nature been transmitted to us.</p>

  <p>The "Orationes varias," probably a collection of sermons with especial
  reference to the sins of the day would have been historically, if not
  otherwise, interesting, and their loss is matter for regret. On the other
  hand the want of the treatise, "De fide orthodoxa," is doubtless a relief
  to literature. There are too many of the kind already to encumber our
  shelves and our catalogues.</p>

  <p>The Lives of the Saints, the work, it is stated, of the author's old
  age, were, according to Tanner, and he is no doubt right, translations
  from the Latin. Barclay's reputation probably does not suffer from their
  loss.</p>

  <p>"Quinque eglogas ex Mantuano," though Bale mentions also "De miserijs
  aulicorum; Bucolicam Codri; Eglogam quartam," apparently the five, but
  really the first four of the eclogues known to us, are, I am strongly
  inclined to believe, nothing else than these same five eclogues, under,
  to use a bibliographical phrase, "a made up" title. That he mentions
  first, five from Mantuan, and afterwards adds "Bucolicam Codri" and
  "Eglogam quartam," as two distinct eclogues, apparently not from Mantuan,
  while both titles must refer to the same poem, an imitation of Mantuan's
  fifth eclogue, is proof enough that he was not speaking with the
  authority of personal knowledge of these works.</p>

  <p>Johannes Baptista Spagnuoli, commonly called from his native city,
  Mantuan, was the most popular and prolific eclogue writer of the
  fifteenth century, to which Barclay himself testifies:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"As the moste famous Baptist Mantuan</p>
      <p>The best of that sort since Poetes first began."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Barclay's Eclogues being the first attempts of the kind in English,
  Bale's "Ex Mantuano," therefore probably means nothing more than "on the
  model of Mantuan;" otherwise, if it be assumed that five were the whole
  number that ever appeared, it could not apply to the first three, which
  are expressly stated in the title to be from Æneas Sylvius, while if ten
  be assumed, his statement would account for nine, the "quinque eglogas"
  being the five now wanting, but if so, then he has omitted to mention the
  most popular of all the eclogues, the fifth, and has failed to attribute
  to Mantuan two which are undoubtedly due to him.</p>

  <p>The loss of the "Contra Skeltonum," is a matter for regret. That there
  was no love lost between these two contemporaries and chief poets of
  their time is evident enough. Skelton's scathing sarcasm against the
  priesthood no doubt woke his brother satirist's ire, and the latter lets
  no opportunity slip of launching forth his contempt for the laureate of
  Oxford.</p>

  <p>The moralist in announcing the position he assumes in opposition to
  the writer of popular tales, takes care to have a fling at the author of
  "The boke of Phyllyp Sparowe":&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I wryte no Ieste ne tale of Robyn Hode,</p>
      <p>Nor sawe no sparcles, ne sede of vyciousnes;</p>
      <p>Wyse men loue vertue, wylde people wantones,</p>
      <p>It longeth nat to my scyence nor cunnynge,</p>
      <p>For Phylyp the sparowe the (Dirige) to synge."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A sneer to which Skelton most probably alludes when, enumerating his
  own productions in the Garlande of Laurell, he mentions,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Of Phillip Sparow the lamentable fate,</p>
      <p>The dolefull desteny, and the carefull chaunce,</p>
      <p>Dyuysed by Skelton after the funerall rate;</p>
      <p>Yet sum there be therewith that take greuaunce,</p>
      <p>And grudge thereat with frownyng countenaunce;</p>
      <p>But what of that? harde it is to please all men;</p>
      <p>Who list amende it, let hym set to his penne."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The following onslaught in Barclay's Fourth Eclogue, is evidently
  levelled at the abominable Skelton:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Another thing yet is greatly more damnable:</p>
      <p>Of rascolde poetes yet is a shamfull rable,</p>

      <p>If they haue smelled the artes triuiall,</p>
      <p>They count them Poetes hye and heroicall.</p>
      <p>Such is their foly, so foolishly they dote,</p>
      <p>Thinking that none can their playne errour note;</p>
      <p>Yet be they foolishe, auoyde of honestie,</p>
      <p>Nothing seasoned with spice of grauitie,</p>
      <p>Auoyde of pleasure, auoyde of eloquence,</p>
      <p>With many wordes, and fruitlesse of sentence;</p>
      <p>Unapt to learne, disdayning to be taught,</p>
      <p>Their priuate pleasure in snare hath them so caught;</p>
      <p>And worst yet of all, they count them excellent,</p>
      <p>Though they be fruitlesse, rashe and improuident.</p>
      <p>To such ambages who doth their minde incline,</p>
      <p>They count all other as priuate of doctrine,</p>
      <p>And that the faultes which be in them alone,</p>
      <p>And be common in other men eche one.</p>
      <p>Thus bide good poetes oft time rebuke and blame,</p>
      <p>Because of other which haue despised name.</p>
      <p>And thus for the bad the good be cleane abject.</p>
      <p>Their art and poeme counted of none effect,</p>
      <p>Who wanteth reason good to discerne from ill</p>
      <p>Doth worthy writers interprete at his will:</p>
      <p>So both the laudes of good and not laudable</p>
      <p>For lacke of knowledge become vituperable."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It has not hitherto been pointed out that Skelton did not disdain to
  borrow a leaf from the enemy's book and try his hand at paraphrasing the
  Ship of Fools also. "The Boke of three fooles, M. Skelton, poete
  laureate, gaue to my lord Cardynall," is a paraphrase in prose, with
  introductory verses, of three chapters of Brandt, corresponding to
  Barclay's chapters headed, Of yonge folys that take olde wym<span
  class="over">e</span> to theyr wyues nat for loue but for ryches (I.
  247); Of enuyous folys (I. 252); Of bodely lust or corporall voluptuosyte
  (I. 239). Skelton's three fools, are, "The man that doth wed a wyfe for
  her goodes and her rychesse;" "Of Enuye, the seconde foole"; and, "Of the
  Voluptuousnes corporall, the third foole;" and his versions are dashed
  off with his usual racy vigour. He probably, however, did not think it
  worth while to compete with the established favourite. If he had we would
  certainly have got a very different book from Barclay's.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding his popularity and industry, Barclay's name appears to
  be but seldom mentioned by contemporary or later authors. As early as
  1521 however, we find him placed in the most honourable company by Henry
  Bradshaw, "Lyfe of Saynt Werburghe," (1521, Pynson, 4to). But the
  compliment would probably lose half its sweetness from his being
  bracketed with the detested Skelton:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Praye them all of pardon both erly and late.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Bulleyn's repeated allusions to Barclay (see above, pp. xxvii., liv.),
  apart from the probability that, as contemporaries resident in the same
  provincial town, Ely, they were well acquainted with each other, leave
  little doubt that the two were personal friends. Bulleyn's figurative
  description of the poet, quoted at p. xxvii., is scarcely complete
  without the following verses, which are appended to it by way of summary
  of his teachings (similar verses are appended to the descriptions of
  Chaucer, Gower, &amp;c.):&mdash;[Barclay appears] saying</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Who entreth the court in yong and t<span class="over">e</span>der age</p>
      <p>Are lightly blinded with foly and outrage:</p>
      <p>But suche as enter with witte and grauitie,</p>
      <p>Bow not so sone to such enormitie,</p>
      <p>But ere thei enter if thei haue lerned nought</p>
      <p>Afterwardes Vertue the least of theyr thought."</p>
      <p class="i20"><i>Dialogue against the Fever Pestilence.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In another passage of the same Dialogue<a name="Ft_4"
  href="#FtN_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the picture of the honourable and
  deserving but neglected churchman is touched with so much strength and
  feeling that, though no indication is given, one cannot but believe that
  the painter was drawing from the life, the life of his friend. The
  likeness, whether intentional or not, is a most faithful one: "The third
  [picture] is, one whiche sheweth the state of learned men, labouring long
  time in studie and diuine vertue, whiche are wrapped in pouertie, wantyng
  the golden rake or gapyng mouth. This man hath verie fewe to preferre hym
  to that promotion, he smiteth himselfe up<span class="over">o</span> the
  breast, he wepeth and lamenteth, that vice should thus be exalted,
  ignoraunce rewarded with glorie, coueteous men spoilyng the Churche, by
  the names of patrones and geuers, whiche extorcioners and tellers, they
  care not to whom, so that it be raked with the golden racke. Wel, wel,
  God of his mercie, am<span class="over">e</span>d this euill market."</p>

  <p>In one of the many humorous sallies which lighten up this
  old-fashioned antidote to the pestilence, Barclay again appears, dressed
  in the metaphorical colour of the poet or minstrel&mdash;green, which has
  probably here a double significance, referring no doubt to his popularity
  as the English eclogue writer as well as to his fame as a poet and
  satirist. In introducing "Bartlet, grene breche" as the antithesis to
  "Boner wepyng," allusion was also probably intended to the honourable
  position occupied by Barclay amongst the promoters of the Reformation,
  compared with the reapostacy, the career of brutal cruelty, and the
  deserved fate of the Jefferies of the Episcopal bench.</p>

  <p>Thus discourse <i>Civis et Uxor</i>.&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>Uxor.</i> What are all these two and two in a table. Oh it is
  trim. <i>Civis.</i> These are old frendes, it is well handled and
  workemanly. Willyam Boswell in Pater noster rowe, painted them. Here is
  Christ, and Sathan, Sainct Peter, and Symon Magus, Paule, and Alex<span
  class="over">a</span>der the Coppersmith, Trace, and Becket, Martin
  Luther, and the Pope ... bishop Cr<span class="over">a</span>mer, and
  bishop Gardiner. Boner wepyng, Bartlet, grene breche ... Salomon, and
  Will Sommer. The cocke and the lyon, the wolfe and the lambe." This
  passage also necessarily implies that Barclay's fame at that time was
  second to none in England. Alas! for fame:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"What is the end of fame? 'Tis but to fill</p>
      <p>A certain portion of uncertain paper."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the seventeenth century Barclay still held a place in the first
  rank of satirists, if we accept the evidence of the learned Catholic poet
  of that time, Sir Aston Cokaine. He thus alludes to him in an address "To
  my learned friend, Mr Thomas Bancroft, upon his Book of Satires. By Sir
  Aston Cokayne."</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"After a many works of divers kinds</p>
      <p>Your muse to tread th' Aruncan path designs:</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Tis hard to write but Satires in these days,</p>
      <p>And yet to write good Satires merits praise:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ·</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In concluding this imperfect notice of one of the most remarkable of
  our early writers, we cannot but echo the regret expressed by one of his
  biographers, that "What ought most to be lamented is, that we are able to
  say so very little of one in his own time so famous, and whose works
  ought to have transmitted him to posterity with much greater honour."</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="FtN_1" href="#Ft_1">[1]</a> <span class="sc">Barclay's
  Nationality</span></p>

  <p>The objection raised to claiming Barclay as a Scotsman, founded on the
  ground that he nowhere mentions his nationality, though it was a common
  practice of authors in his time to do so, especially when they wrote out
  of their own country, appeared to me, though ingenious and pertinent, to
  be of so little real weight, as to be dismissed in a parenthesis. Its
  importance, however, may easily be overrated, and it may therefore be
  well to point out that, apart from the possibility that this omission on
  his part was the result of accident or indifference, there is also the
  probability that it was dictated by a wise discretion. To be a Scotsman
  was not in the days of Henry VIII., as it has been in later and more
  auspicious times, a passport to confidence and popularity, either at the
  court or among the people of England. Barclay's fate having led him, and
  probably his nearest relatives also, across that Border which no Scotsman
  ever recrosses, to live and labour among a people by no means friendly to
  his country, it would have been a folly which so sensible a man as he was
  not likely to commit to have displayed the red rag of his nationality
  before his easily excited neighbours, upon whose friendliness his comfort
  and success depended. The farther argument of the Biographia Brittannica,
  that "it is pretty extraordinary that Barclay himself, in his several
  addresses to his patrons, should never take notice of his being a
  stranger, which would have made their kindness to him the more
  remarkable," is sufficiently disposed of by the succeeding statement,
  that the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Kent, Barclay's principal
  patrons, "are known to have been the fiercest enemies of the Scots."
  Surely a man who was English in everything but his birth could not be
  expected to openly blazon his Scottish nativity, without adequate
  occasion for so doing, in the very face of his country's chiefest
  enemies, who were at the same time his own best friends. His caution in
  this respect, indeed, may be regarded as an additional proof of his
  Scottish origin.</p>

  <p><a name="FtN_2" href="#Ft_2">[2]</a> <span class="sc">Barclay's
  Vocabulary</span></p>

  <p>Some of the words, stated in popular fashion to be Scotch&mdash;they
  are of course of Saxon origin&mdash;the usage of which by Barclay is
  adduced as an evidence of his nationality, are also to be found in
  Chaucer, but that does not invalidate the argument as stated. The
  employment of so many words of northern usage must form at least a strong
  corroborative argument in favour of northern origin.</p>

  <p><a name="FtN_3" href="#Ft_3">[3]</a> <span class="sc">The Castle of
  Labour</span></p>

  <p>It ought to be stated that the modesty of the young author prevented
  him from affixing his name to his first production, The Castle of Labour.
  Both editions are anonymous. Bale, Pits, Wood, &amp;c., all include it in
  the list of his works without remark.</p>

  <p><a name="FtN_4" href="#Ft_4">[4]</a> <span class="sc">Bulleyn's
  Dialogue</span></p>

  <p>A notice of the history of this once popular Dialogue, its ever
  recurring disappearance, and ever recurring "discovery" by some fortunate
  antiquary, would form an interesting chapter in a new "History of the
  transmission of ancient books to modern times." Its chances of
  preservation and record were unusually favourable. It must have been
  disseminated over the length and breadth of the land in its day, having
  run through four editions in little more than a dozen years. Maunsell's
  Catalogue (1595) records the edition of 1578. Antony Wood (1721), and
  Bishop Tanner (1748) both duly give it a place in their notices of the
  productions of its author, without any special remark. But the Biographia
  Brittanica (1748) in a long article upon Bulleyn, in which his various
  works are noticed in great detail, introduces the Dialogue as "<i>this
  long neglected and unknown treatise</i>," and gives an elaborate account
  of it extending to about five columns of small print. The now famous
  passage, descriptive of the early poets, is quoted at length, and special
  notice of its bearing on Barclay's nationality taken, the writer (Oldys)
  announcing that the dispute must now be settled in favour of Scotland,
  "Seeing our author (Bulleyn), a contemporary who lived in, and long upon
  the borders of Scotland, says, as above, he was born in that kingdom: and
  as much indeed might have been in great measure gathered from an
  attentive perusal of this poet himself."</p>

  <p>The next biographer of Bulleyn, Aikin (Biog. Memoirs of Medicine,
  1780), makes no discovery, but contents himself with giving a brief
  account of the Dialogue (in 1½ pages), in which the description of
  Chaucer, &amp;c., is duly noticed. Three years later, in spite of this,
  and the appearance of a second edition of the Biographia Brittanica
  (1778), another really learned and able antiquary, Waldron, in his
  edition of Jonson's Sad Shepherd (1783), comes forth triumphantly
  announcing his discovery of the Dialogue as that of a hitherto totally
  unknown treasure; and in an appendix favours the curious with a series of
  extracts from it, extending to more than thirty pages, prefacing them
  thus: "Having, among the various Mysteries and Moralities, whether
  original impressions, reprinted, or described only by those writers who
  have given any account of these Embrios of the English Drama, <i>never
  met with or read of any other copy of the Dialogue, or Morality, by
  Bulleyn, than the one</i>, [which I have used], an account of and some
  extracts from it may not be unpleasing." The passage regarding the poets
  is of course given <i>ad longum</i>.</p>

  <p>The next notice of the Dialogue occurs in Herbert's Ames (1786), where
  two editions, 1564 and 1578, are entered. Dibdin (1819), in addition,
  notices the edition of 1573. In the biographical accounts of Bulleyn in
  Hutchinson's Biographia Medica (1799), Aikin's General Biog. Dict.
  (1801), and its successor, Chalmers's Biog. Dict. (1812), due mention is
  preserved of the Dialogue in enumerating the works of its author. Sir
  Walter Scott alludes to it in the Introduction to the Minstrelsy of the
  Scottish Border (1802) as a "mystery," but his only knowledge of it is
  evidently derived from Waldron. Chalmers's Life of Lindsay (Poetical
  Works, 1806) has also kept it prominently before a considerable class of
  inquirers, as he gives that part of the description of the poets relating
  to Lindsay a conspicuous place, with the following note: "Owing to the
  very obliging temper of Mr Waldron I have been permitted to see that
  <i>rare book</i> of Dr Bulleyn, with the second edition of 1569, which is
  remarkably different from the first in 1564." To this use of it by
  Chalmers we owe the references to it in Lord Lindsay's Lives of the
  Lindsays, i. 261 (1849), Seton's Scottish Heraldry, 480 (1863), and Notes
  and Queries, 3rd s., iv. 164 (1863). It was also probably Chalmers that
  drew the attention of the writer of the Memoir of Barclay in the Lives of
  the Scottish Poets (1822), to the possibility of there being also in the
  Dialogue notice of that poet. At any rate, he quotes the description of
  the early poets, showing in his preliminary remarks considerable
  familiarity with Bulleyn's history, pointing out the probability of his
  having known Barclay at Ely, and arguing that whether or not, "from
  living in the same neighbourhood he had an opportunity of knowing better
  than any contemporary whose evidence on the subject is extant, to what
  country Barclay was, by all about him, reputed to belong." He precedes
  his quotations thus: "As the whole passage possesses considerable
  elegance, and has been so <i>universally overlooked</i> by the critics,
  the transcription of it here will not probably be deemed out of place."
  No mention is made of the title of the book from which the "Allegorical
  Description of the Early English Poets" is taken; hence it is impossible
  to say whether the quoter made use of a copy of the Dialogue, or of
  Waldron's Notes. The spelling is modernised.</p>

  <p>In various well-known bibliographical publications the existence of
  this fugitive Dialogue is carefully registered, and its title, at least,
  made known to all inquirers,&mdash;in Watt's Bibliotheca Britt. (1824),
  in Lowndes' Bibliog. Manual (1834), and in Atkinson's Medical Bibliog.
  (1834); and by the published Catalogues of the British Museum (1813), the
  Douce Collection (1840), and the Bodleian Library (1843), it is made
  known that there are copies of it preserved in these great collections.
  In Warton's Hist. of Eng. Poetry (ed. 1840), it is also recorded by Park,
  in his notes to the chapter on Gower, in which he refers to Bulleyn's
  visionary description of that poet. Cooper's Athenæ Cantabrigienses, art.
  Bulleyn (1858), also carefully notes the Dialogue and its editions. And
  in 1865 Collier's well-known Bibliographical Account of Early English
  Literature again gives an account (two pages long) of the much neglected
  production, in which the passage relating to the poets is once more
  extracted in full, with the preliminary remarks as quoted at p. xxvii.
  <i>supra</i>, but without the usual announcement that the work has
  hitherto been unknown.</p>

  <p>But in 1873, by the very last man from whom we might have expected it
  (F. J. Furnivall, the Atlas on whose shoulders all our projects for the
  preservation of our early literature rest, in Notes and Queries, 4th s.,
  xii. 161), we are again introduced to this ever disappearing, ever
  reappearing Dialogue as a fresh find in early English literature: "Few
  things are pleasanter in reading old books than to come on a passage of
  praise of our old poets, showing that in Tudor days men cared for the
  'makers' of former days as we do still. To Mr David Laing's kindness I
  owe the introduction to the following quotation from a rare tract, where
  one wouldn't have expected to find such a passage," and then follows once
  more the whole passage so often quoted for the first time. Dr Rimbault,
  in an interesting note in a succeeding number of Notes and Queries (p.
  234), is the first one acquainted with the Dialogue to state that "this
  amusing old work is perfectly well known, and has often been quoted
  from." So henceforth we may presume that this interesting and
  long-fertile field of discovery may be regarded as finally worked
  out.</p>

  <p>I. <span class="sc">The Castell of Laboure</span>.&mdash;Wynkyn de
  Worde. 1506. Small Quarto. Black letter.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>The title, "The castell of laboure," is within a scroll above a
  woodcut of men over a tub: on the verso, a cut of a man sitting at a
  desk. At sign. a ii. (recto) "Here begynneth the prologue of this present
  treatyse." [The Brit. Mus. copy has this on the verso of the title
  instead of the cut, a peculiarity which may entitle it to be called a
  separate edition, though it appears to agree otherwise with the copy
  described.] There are many curious woodcuts. Colophon on the reverse of
  sign. i iii. (51<sup>b</sup>): "Thus endeth the castell of labour, wherin
  is rychesse, vertue, and honour. Enprynted at London in Fletestrete in
  the sygne of the sonne. by Wynkyn de worde. Anno d<span
  class="over">n</span>i M.ccccc.vi." There is no indication of authorship.
  Signatures: a b c d e f g h, alternately 8s and 4s, i 4; 52 leaves, not
  numbered. The British Museum and Cambridge University Library copies of
  this book have been collated, but as the former ends with H 3 and the
  latter wants the last leaf, that leaf must remain undescribed. Mr
  Bradshaw, however, says, "it almost certainly contained a woodcut on the
  recto, and one of the devices on the verso."</p>

  <p>A copy of this very scarce book was sold among Mr. West's books in
  1773 for £2.</p>

  <p>I.<i>a</i>. <span class="sc">The Castell of
  Laboure</span>.&mdash;Pynson. No date. Small Quarto. Black letter.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>The title, "Here begynneth the castell of laboure," is over a woodcut;
  and on the reverse is a woodcut; both the same as those in the previous
  edition. In the body of the work there are 30 woodcuts, which differ from
  those of the first edition, one of these (at G 6) is a repetition of that
  on the title page. Colophon: "Thus endeth the castell of labour wherin is
  rychesse, vertue and honoure. Enprynted be me Richarde Pynson." After the
  colophon comes another leaf (I 6), on the recto of which is the printer's
  device, and on the verso a woodcut representing a city on the banks of a
  river. Without indication of authorship. Signatures: A, 8 leaves;
  B&mdash;I, in sixes.</p>

  <p>"Neither Ames nor Herbert appear to have seen this rare volume; which
  is probably a reprint of Wynkyn de Worde's impression of 1506." (Dibdin's

  Esq.</p>

  <p>II. <span class="sc">The Ship of Folys of the
  Worlde</span>.&mdash;Pynson. 1509. Folio.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>On the recto of the first leaf there is a large woodcut of Pynson's
  arms, or device No. VII., similar to that which is on the reverse of the
  last leaf of each of the volumes of his edition of Lord Berners'
  translation of Froissart's Chronicles; on the back of the first leaf is
  the translator's dedication to "Thomas Cornisshe, bishop of Tine, and
  suffragan bishop of Bath;" on the next leaf begins "The regyster or table
  of this present boke in Englyshe," (all as on pp. cxiii.&mdash;cxx.),
  succeeded by a Latin table. Then on sign. a i. and fol. i. a large
  woodcut, the same as is used for the title page of Cawood's edition (and
  on p. 313, Vol. II.), with a Latin description in the margin. Beneath is
  the title in Latin. On the back, "Alexander Barclay excusynge the
  rudeness of his translacion," followed with "An exhortacion of Alexander
  Barclay." Then on fol. ii., etc., follow in Latin, "Epigramma,"
  "Epistola" in prose, and various "Carmina." On the back of fol. v. "The
  exhortacion of Brant to the fools" in Latin verse, followed by Barclay's
  version with the heading "Barclay the Translatour tho the Foles." On fol.
  iiii. the "Prologus Jacobi Locher ... incipit," followed by its
  translation into English. On fol. ix., etc., "Hecatastichon in proludium
  auctoris et Libelli Narragonici" and the English translation, "Here
  begynneth the prologe." On xii. "The Argument" in Latin and English, and
  then on xiii. commences the first chapter, "De inutilibus libris," in
  Latin, and then in English, which is the order throughout, with the cuts
  at the beginning of either the one or other as the page suited. The book
  concludes with a ballad in honour of the virgin Mary, consisting of
  twelve octave stanzas: at the end of which is the colophon in a stanza of
  seven lines. On the verso of the last leaf is the printer's device, No.
  v.</p>

  <p>The Latin is uniformly printed in the Roman type, and the English in
  the Gothic. Herbert supposes the diphthongs to be "the first perhaps used
  in this kingdom."</p>

  <p>The cuts are rude, coarse, English imitations of those in the original
  editions. They are, including the preliminary one, 118 in number. The cut
  illustrating the chapter, "Of them that correct other," etc., fol. liii.
  has been exchanged with the cut of the succeeding chapter. The cut
  illustrating "The unyuersall shyp and generall Barke," fol. cclxii., is
  repeated at the succeeding chapter. The one illustrating Barclay's new
  chapter "Of folys that ar ouer worldly" is an imitation of the
  illustration of "De singularitate quorundam novorum fatuorum" in the
  Latin edition of March 1497. The cut illustrating the ballad of the
  Virgin appears in the original at the head of "Excusatio Jacobi Locher
  Philomusi," and illustrates, according to the margin, "Derisio boni
  operis."</p>

  <p>The word "Folium" is on the left hand page, and the number, in Roman
  capitals, on the right throughout the book; the last is cclxxiiii.
  Including the dedication and table (4 folios) there are 283 folios. The
  numbering is a model of irregularity: iiii. is repeated for vi., xx.
  stands for xv., xviii. is repeated, xx. is wanting, xxii. is repeated,
  xxiv. is wanting, xxx. is repeated, xxxvi. is wanting, xxxix. is repeated
  in place of xliv., xlviii. is wanting, xlix. is repeated, lvii is
  repeated after lxi., lviii follows twice, lix., lx., lxi. being repeated
  in succession after lviii., lxvii., lxviii. are repeated after lxviii.,
  lxxxii. is wanting, lxxxiii. is repeated, lxxxii. stands for lxxxvii.,
  lxxxiii. succeeds for lxxxviiii, cclxv. succeeds for lxxxix., lxxxxii. is
  repeated for lxxxxvii., [in the Grenville copy this leaf is correctly
  numbered], cxxxii is wanting, cxl. stands for cxxxviii., cxlxi. stands
  for cxlvi., clxxiv. is wanting, clxxxxxi. stands for cci., ccxii. is
  repeated for ccxvii., ccxxxviii. is wanting, cclx. stands for ccl.,
  cclviii. is repeated for cclx.</p>

  <p>The numeration by signatures is as follows: + iiij; a, 8; b&mdash;p, 6
  s; q, 7; r, s, t, v, x, y, z, &amp;, 6 s; A&mdash;Y, 6 s.</p>

  <p>The book is extremely rare. There is a fine copy in the Bodleian
  Library among Selden's books, another in the British Museum, Grenville
  Collection, and another in the Library of St. John's College, Oxford.</p>

  <p>The following are the more notable prices: Farmer, 1798, £2. 4s.;
  Sotheby's, 1821, £28; Dent, £30. 9s.; Bib. Anglo-Poetica, £105; Perkins,
  1873, £130.</p>

  <p>The following amusing note on prices is taken from Renouard's
  "Catalogue d'un Amateur." "Les premières éditions latines de ce singulier
  livre, celles des traductions françoises, toutes également remplies de
  figures en bois, ne déplaisent pas aux amateurs, mais jamais ils ne les
  ont payées un haut prix. La traduction angloise faite en 1509, sur le
  francois, et avec des figures en bois, plus mauvaises encore que leurs
  modèles, se paye en Angleterre 25, 30 et mème 60 guinées; c'est là, si
  l'on veut, du zèle patriotique, de l'esprit national."</p>

  class="sc">The Ship of Fooles</span>..... With diuers other workes....
  very profitable and fruitfull for all men.... Cawood. 1570. Folio.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>A large cut of vessels filled with fools (the same as on p. 313, Vol.
  II.) is inserted between the Latin and English titles. This edition omits
  the ballad to the Virgin at the end. The English is in black letter, and
  the Latin in Roman, in the same order as in the preceding edition. On the
  recto of leaf 259: Thus endeth the Ship of Fooles, translated ... by
  Alexander Barclay Priest, at that time Chaplen in the Colledge of S. Mary
  Otery in the Countie of Deuon. Anno Domini 1508. On the back "Excusatio
  Iacobi Locher Philomusi," in Sapphic verse. On the next page five stanzas
  by Barclay "excusing the rudenes of his Translation." Lastly, an Index in
  Latin, and then in English. Then, follow the "diuers other workes," the
  Mirrour of good maners, and the Egloges. Colophon: Imprinted at London in
  Paules Church-yarde by Iohn Cawood Printer to the Queenes Maiestie. Cum
  Priuilegio ad imprimendum solum.</p>

  <p>The woodcuts, including the one on the title-page, number 117. They
  are the same as those of Pynson's edition, but show occasional traces of
  the blocks having been chipped in the course of their preservation in a
  printer's office for 60 years or so. The borders only differ, being of a
  uniform type, while those of the previous edition are woodcuts of several
  patterns.</p>

  <p>The numbering is a little irregular; the preliminary leaves (12) are
  unnumbered. The folios are numbered in figures on the left hand page,
  'folio' being prefixed to the first six, 16 is repeated for 17, 13 stands
  for 31, [in one of the Adv. Lib. copies the latter irregularity is found,
  though not the former; in the other, 17 and 31 are numbered correctly],
  96 is repeated for 99, 188 for 191, 100 for 200, and 205 for 201. The
  last number is 259, and there are three extra leaves, thus making 274 for
  the Ship. The supplementary works are not numbered. The signatures are as
  follows: <i>The Ship</i>, ¶ six leaves; ¶¶ six leaves; A to U u, in
  sixes; X x, four leaves; <i>Mirrour of good manners</i>, A&mdash;G, in
  sixes; <i>Egloges</i>, A to D, in sixes; in all 680 pp.</p>

  <p>This book was licensed to Cawood in 1567-8, and is said to be the only
  book he had license for. It is now very rare.</p>

  <p>A complete bibliography of the various editions and versions of the
  Ship of Fools will be found in Zarocke's edition of the original, or in
  Graesse's Trésor de livres rares et précieux. A notice is subjoined of
  the two editions of the English prose translation, and of the two other
  publications bearing the title.</p>

  <p>The abridged prose translation, by Henry Watson, from the French prose
  version of Jehan Droyn, appeared from the press of De Worde in the same
  year in which Barclay's fuller poetical version was issued. In both text
  and illustrations it is a much inferior production to the latter. As the
  existence of the first edition has been, and still is, denied, it being
  frequently confounded with Barclay's book, we transcribe the following
  description of the only known copy from Van Praet's "Catalogue des livres

  compyled by Alexander Barcley compendiously at the comma<span
  class="over">u</span>dem<span class="over">e</span>t of the ryght hye

  over a large woodcut of a lion rampant, supporting a shield, containing a
  white lion in a border, (the same as that on the title of the Sallust,
  VI.), then follows a French ballad of 16 lines in two columns, the first
  headed, "R. Coplande to the whyte lyone, and the second, "¶ Ballade." On
  the recto of the last leaf, 'Here foloweth the maner of dauncynge of bace

  <p>In the edition of Palsgrave (see above, p. lxxiii.), published among
  the "Documents inédits sur l'histoire de France," the editor says of this
  work of Barclay's: "Tous mes efforts pour découvrir un exemplaire de ce
  curieux ouvrage ont été inutiles." There is a copy, probably unique, in
  the Bodleian; it was formerly Herbert's, afterwards Douce's.</p>

  <p>All the parts of this treatise relating to French pronunciation have
  been carefully reprinted by Mr A. J. Ellis, in his treatise "On Early
  English Pronunciation" (published by the Philological Society), Part
  III., p. 804.</p>

  "This edition differs materially from that used by Herbert, which has led
  Dr Dibdin to the conclusion that there were two impressions." So says a
  MS. note on the copy, (quoted in the Bib. Grenv.), but Dibdin does not
  commit himself to the conclusion, his words being these: "This
  description is given from a copy in the possession of Mr Heber; which,
  from its varying with the account of Herbert, Mr H. supposes, with
  justice, must be a different one from Herbert's." I have failed to
  discover the difference.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Here begynneth the famous cronycle of the warre, which the romayns
  had agaynst Jugurth, vsurper of the kyngdome of Numidy. which cronycle is
  compyled in latyn by the renowmed romayne Salust. And translated into
  englysshe by syr Alexander Barclay preest, at c<span
  class="over">o</span>maundement of the right hye and mighty prince:
  Thomas duke of Northfolke." There are two editions by Pynson of this
  book.</p>

  <p>I. In this edition the lower half of the title page has a square
  enclosed by double lines containing the Norfolk arms, a lion rampant,
  holding a shield in his paws, on which is another lion, a cut which also
  appears on the title of The Introductory. There is a full page cut of the
  royal arms with portcullis, &amp;c., on the back, followed by five pages
  of Table. The preface to his patron, in English,&mdash;&mdash;together
  with a Latin dedication to Bishop Veysy, in parallel
  columns,&mdash;&mdash;begins on the verso of signature <span
  class="sc">a</span> iiii, under a cut of the author presenting his book
  to him, the same as that which appears on the title of The myrrour of
  good maners. [See the cut prefixed to the Notice of Barclay's life, which
  is confined however to a reproduction of the two principal figures only,
  two other figures, evidently of servants, and some additional
  ornamentation of the room being omitted.] At the end of this preface is
  another cut of the author, writing at a desk; also on the back of the
  leaf is a cut of the disembarking of an army. There are no other cuts,
  but the volume is adorned throughout with very fine woodcut initials.
  Catchwords are given irregularly at the beginning, but regularly towards
  the end, at the bottom of the left hand page only, but the preface has
  them to every column. Colophon:&mdash;&mdash;"Thus endeth the famous
  cronycle of the war ... imprented at London by Rycharde Pynson printer
  vnto the kynges noble grace: with priuylege vnto hym gra<span
  class="over">u</span>ted by our sayd souerayne lorde the kynge." On the
  back of the last leaf is Pynson's device, No. v. The date is erroneously
  conjectured in Moss's Classical Bib. to be 1511. It was probably 1519,
  certainly between 1519 and 1524. Contains 92 numbered leaves, and one
  leaf unnumbered, besides eight leaves of preliminary matter: numbering
  quite regular: signatures; a 8, A&mdash;O, 6 s, P, Q, 4 s. In the British
  Museum, Grenville Collection, the Bodleian, and the Public Library at
  Cambridge.</p>

  Sotheby's, 1857, £10.</p>

  <p>II. In this edition, the title page is the same as in the other with
  the exception of a semicolon for a full point after Numidy, the
  succeeding which having an e added, and romayne being without the e, but
  on the back instead of a cut of the royal arms The table commences; the
  preface begins on the recto of sign. a 4, under the cut of the author
  presenting his book to the Duke of Norfolk, and ends without the leaf of
  woodcuts which is appended to the preface of the first edition. Pynson's
  device at the end of the book is also wanting in this edition. It
  contains only fol. lxxxvi., with six leaves of preliminary matter; the
  pagination is a little irregular, xxi. and xxii. are wanting but xxiii.
  is given three times, and lxxvii. is repeated for lxxviii.; the British
  Museum copy is deficient in folios lxii. and lxv.: signatures; a 6,
  A&mdash;N, 6 s, and O, P, 4 s. The initials are the same as those in the
  first edition in the great majority of cases, but appear much more worn.
  There are catch-words only at the end of every signature throughout the
  book, except to the preface, which has them to every column. In the
  British Museum, and the Public Library, Cambridge.</p>

<h3>[The Prologe of James Locher.]</h3>

  <p>After that I haue longe mused by my self of the sore confounded and
  vncertayne cours of mannys lyfe, and thinges therto belonginge: at the
  last I haue by my vigilant meditacion found and noted many degrees of
  errours: wherby mankynd wandreth from the way of trouth I haue also noted
  that many wyse men and wel lettred haue writen right fruteful doctrines:
  wherby they haue heled these dyseses and intollerable perturbacions of
  the mynde: and the goostly woundes therof, moche better than Esculapius
  which was fyrst Inuentour of Phesyke and amonge the Gentyles worshypped
  as a God. In the contrey of Grece were stodyes fyrst founded and ordeyned
  in the which began and sprange holsom medicyne which gaue vnto infect
  myndes frutful doctryne and norisshinge. Amonge whome Socrates that great
  begynner and honourer of wysdom began to dispute of ye maners of men. But
  for that he coude nat fynde certayne ende of goodnes and hyest felicite
  in naturall thinges: nor induce men to the same, he gaue the hye
  contemplacions of his mynde to moral vertues. And in so moche passed he
  al other in Philosophy moral that it was sayde that he called Philosophy
  down from the Imperial heuen. whan this Socrates perceyued the mindes of
  men to be prone, and extremely inclyned to viciousnes he had gret
  affeccion to subdue suche maners. Wherfore in comon places of the Cyte of
  Athenes he instruct and infourmed the peple in such doctrynes as
  compasith the clere and immaculate welles of the moste excellent and
  souerayne gode. After the disces of Socrates succeded ye godly Plato
  whiche in moral Philosophy ouerpassed also a great part of his tyme And
  certaynly nat without a cause was he called godly. For by what stody
  myght be more holely or better socour mankynde than by suche doctrynes as
  he gaue. He wrote and ordeyned lawes moste egal and iust He edityed vnto
  the Grekes a comon welthe stable, quyet and commendable. And ordeyned the
  societe and company of them most iocund and amyable. He prepared a brydel
  to refrayne the lust and sensualyte of the body. And fynally he changed
  the yl ignorance feblenes and negligence of youth vnto dylygence,
  strength and vertue. In tyme also of these Phylosophers sprange the
  florisshynge age of Poetes: whiche amonge lettred men had nat smal rowme
  and place. And that for theyr eloquent Retoryke and also for theyr mery
  ficcions and inuencions. Of the whiche Poetes some wrote in moste ornate
  termes in ditees heroycal wherin the noble actes and lyues both of dyuyne
  and humayne creatures ar wont to be noted and writem. Some wrote of
  tylling of the grounde. Some of the Planetes, of the courses of ye
  sterres: and of the mouynge of the heuyn and fyrmament. Some of the
  Empyre and shameful subieccion of disordred loue. And many other of the
  myserable ruyne and fal of Kynges and princes for vice: as Tragedies. And
  some other wrote Comedyes with great libertye of speche: which Comedies
  we cal Interludes. Amonge whome Aristophanes Eupolis and Cratinus mooste
  laudable Poetes passed al other. For whan they sawe the youth of Athenes
  and of al the remanent of Grece inclyned to al ylles they toke occasion
  to note suche myslyuinge. And so in playne wordes they repreued without
  fauour the vyces of the sayd yl disposyd peple of what condicion or order
  they were: Of this auncient wrytinge of Comedyes our laten Poetes deuysed
  a maner of wrytinge nat inelegant. And fyrst Lucilius composed one Satyre
  in the whiche he wrote by name the vices of certayne princes and Citezyns
  of Rome And that with many bourdes so y<sup>t</sup> with his mery speche
  myxt with rebukes he correct al them of the cyte that disordredly lyued.
  But this mery speche vsed he nat in his writing to the intent to
  excercyse wanton wordes or vnrefrayned lascyuyte, or to put his pleasour
  in suche dissolute langage: but to ye intent to quenche vyces and to
  prouoke the commons to wysdome and vertue, and to be asshamed of theyr
  foly and excessyfe lyuynge. of hym all the Latyn poetes haue takyn
  example, and begynnynge to wryte Satyrs whiche the grekes named Comedyes:
  As Fabius specifyeth in his X boke of institucions. After Lucilius
  succeded Horacius, moche more eloquent in wrytynge whiche in the same
  deseruyd great laude: Persius also left to vs onely one boke by the
  whiche he commyttyd his name and laude to perpetuall memory. The last and
  prynce of all was Juuenall whiche in his iocunde poemys comprehendyd al
  that was wryten most eloquent and pleasaunt of all the poetis of that
  sorte afore his tyme: O noble men, and diligent hertes and myndes, o
  laudable maners and tymes, these worthy men exyled ydelnes, wherby they
  haue obtayned nat small worshyp and great commodyte example and doctryne
  lefte to vs theyr posteryours why begyn we nat to vnderstonde and
  perceyue. Why worshyp nat the people of our tyme these poetis why do nat
  they reuerence to ye interpretours of them do they nat vnderstonde: that
  no poetes wryte, but outher theyr mynde is to do pleasure or els profyte
  to the reder, or ellys they togyther wyll doo bothe profyte and pleasoure
  why are they dyspysed of many rude carters of nowe a dayes which
  vnderstonde nat them, And for lacke of them haue nat latyn to vtter and
  expresse ye wyl of their mynde. Se whether poetes ar to be dispised. they
  laude vertue and hym that vseth it rebukyng vices with the vsers therof,
  They teche what is good and what is euyll: to what ende vyce, and what
  ende vertue bringeth vs, and do nat Poetis reuyle and sharply byte in
  their poemys all suche as ar vnmeke, Prowde, Couetous, Lecherous, Wanton,
  delycyous, Wrathfull glotons, wasters, Enuyours, Enchauntours,
  faythebrakers, rasshe, vnauysed, malapert, drunken, vntaught foles, and
  suche lyke. Shulde theyr writyng that suche thinges disprayse and reuyle
  be dyspised of many blynde Dotardes y<sup>t</sup> nowe lyue whiche enuy
  that any man shulde haue or vnderstonde ye thyng whiche they knowe nat.
  The Poetes also wyth great lawdes commende and exalt the noble folowers
  of vertue ascribyng to euery man rewardes after his merytes. And shortly
  to say, the intencion of al Poetes hath euer ben to repreue vyce: and to
  commende vertue. But syns it is so that nowe in our dayes ar so many
  neglygent and folysshe peple that they ar almost innumerable whiche
  despisynge the loue of vertue: folowe the blyndenes and vanyte of this
  worlde: it was expedient that of newe some lettred man, wyse, and subtil
  of wyt shulde awake and touche ye open vices of foles that now lyue: and
  blame theyr abhomynable lyfe. This fourme and lybertye of writinge, and
  charge hathe taken vpon hym the Right excellent and worthy Mayster
  Sebastian Brant Doctour of both the Lawes and noble Oratour and Poete to
  the comon welthe of al people in playne and comon speche of Doche in the
  contrey of Almayne: to the ymytacion of Dant Florentyne: and Francis
  Petrarche Poetes heroycal which in their maternal langage haue composed
  maruelous Poemes and ficcions. But amonge diuers inuencions composed of
  the sayde Sebastian brant I haue noted one named ye Shyp of Foles moche
  expedient and necessary to the redar which the sayd Sebastian composed in
  doche langage. And after hym one called James Locher his Disciple
  translated the same into Laten to the vnderstondinge of al Christen
  nacions where Laten is spoken. Than another (whose name to me is
  vnknowen) translated the same into Frenche. I haue ouersene the fyrst
  Inuencion in Doche and after that the two translations in Laten and
  Frenche whiche in blaminge the disordred lyfe of men of our tyme agreeth
  in sentence: threfolde in langage wherfore wylling to redres the errours
  and vyces of this oure Royalme of Englonde: as the foresayde composer and
  translatours hath done in theyr Contrees I haue taken vpon me: howbeit
  vnworthy to drawe into our Englysshe tunge the sayd boke named ye shyp of
  folys as nere to ye sayd thre Langages as the parcyte of my wyt wyll
  suffer me. But ye reders gyue ye pardon vnto Alexander de Barklay If
  ignoraunce negligence or lacke of wyt cause hym to erre in this
  translacion his purpose and synguler desyre is to content youre myndes.
  And sothely he hathe taken vpon hym the translacion of this present Boke
  neyther for hope of rewarde nor lawde of man: but onely for the holsome
  instruccion commodyte and Doctryne of wysdome, and to clense the vanyte
  and madnes of folysshe people of whom ouer great nombre is in the Royalme
  of Englonde. Therfore let euery man beholde and ouerrede this boke: And
  than I doute nat but he shal se the errours of his lyfe of what condycyon
  that he be. in lyke wyse as he shal se in a Myrrour the fourme of his
  countenaunce and vysage: And if he amende suche fautes as he redeth here
  wherein he knoweth hymself gylty, and passe forth the resydue of his lyfe
  in the order of good maners than shall he haue the fruyte and auauntage
  wherto I haue translatyd this boke.</p>

<h3>[The Argument.]</h3>

  <p>Here after foloweth the Boke named the Shyp of Foles of the world:
  translated out of Laten, French and Doche into Englysse in the Colege of
  saynt Mary Otery By me Alexander Barclay to the felicite and moste holsom
  instruccion of mankynde the whiche conteyneth al suche as wandre from the
  way of trouth and from the open Path of holsom vnderstondynge and wysdom:
  fallynge into dyuers blyndnesses of ye mynde, folysshe sensualytees, and
  vndlawful delectacions of the body. This present Boke myght haue ben
  callyd nat inconuenyently the Satyr (that is to say) the reprehencion of
  foulysshnes, but the neweltye of the name was more plesant vnto the fyrst
  actour to call it the Shyp of foles: For in lyke wyse as olde Poetes
  Satyriens in dyuers Poesyes conioyned repreued the synnes and ylnes of
  the peple at that tyme lyuynge: so and in lyke wyse this our Boke
  representeth vnto the iyen of the redars the states and condicions of
  men: so that euery man may behold within the same the cours of his lyfe
  and his mysgouerned maners, as he sholde beholde the shadowe of the
  fygure of his visage within a bright Myrrour. But concernynge the
  translacion of this Boke: I exhort ye reders to take no displesour for
  y<sup>t</sup> it is nat translated word by worde acordinge to ye verses
  of my actour. For I haue but only drawen into our moder tunge, in rude
  langage the sentences of the verses as nere as the parcyte of my wyt wyl
  suffer me, some tyme addynge, somtyme detractinge and takinge away suche
  thinges a semeth me necessary and superflue. wherfore I desyre of you
  reders pardon of my presumptuous audacite trustynge that ye shall holde
  me excused if ye consyder ye scarsnes of my wyt and my vnexpert youthe. I
  haue in many places ouerpassed dyuers poetical digressions and obscurenes
  of Fables and haue concluded my worke in rude langage as shal apere in my
  translacion. But the speciyl cawse that mouethe me to this besynes is to
  auoyde the execrable inconuenyences of ydilnes whyche (as saint Bernard
  sayth) is moder of al vices: and to the vtter derision of obstynat men
  delitynge them in folyes and mysgouernance. But bycause the name of this
  boke semeth to the redar to procede of derysion: and by that mean that
  the substance therof shulde nat be profitable: I wyl aduertise you that
  this Boke is named the Shyp of foles of the worlde: For this worlde is
  nought els but a tempestous se in the whiche we dayly wander and are
  caste in dyuers tribulacions paynes and aduersitees: some by ignoraunce
  and some by wilfulnes: wherfore suche doers ar worthy to be called foles.
  syns they gyde them nat by reason as creatures resonable ought to do.
  Therfore the fyrst actoure willynge to deuyde suche foles from wysemen
  and gode lyuers: hathe ordeyned vpon the se of this worlde this present
  Shyp to contayne these folys of ye worlde, whiche ar in great nomber. So
  that who redeth it perfytely consyderynge his secrete dedys, he shall not
  lyghtly excuse hym selfe out of it, what so euer good name y<sup>t</sup>
  he hath outwarde in the mouth of the comontye, And to the entent
  y<sup>t</sup> this my laboure may be the more pleasaunt vnto lettred men,
  I haue adioyned vnto the same ye verses of my Actour with dyuerse
  concordaunces of the Bybyll to fortyfy my wrytynge by the same, and also
  to stop the enuyous mouthes (If any suche shal be) of them that by malyce
  shall barke ayenst this my besynes.</p>
